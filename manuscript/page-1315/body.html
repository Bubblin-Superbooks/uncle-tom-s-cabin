<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I tried to make the child respectful;&mdash;I tried to keep them apart, for I held on to those children like death; but it did no good. He sold both those children. He took me to ride, one day, and when I came home, they were nowhere to be found! He told me he had sold them; he showed me the money, the price of their blood. Then it seemed as if all good forsook me. I raved and cursed,&mdash;cursed God and man; and, for a while, I believe, he really was afraid of me. But he didn&rsquo;t give up so. He told me that my children were sold, but whether I ever saw their faces again, depended on him; and that, if I wasn&rsquo;t quiet, they should smart for it. Well, you can do anything with a woman, when you&rsquo;ve got her children. He made me submit; he made me be peaceable; he flattered me with hopes that, perhaps, he would buy them back; and so things went on, a week or two.</p></div> </div>
