<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>But to live,&mdash;to wear on, day after day, of mean, bitter, low, harassing servitude, every nerve dampened and depressed, every power of feeling gradually smothered,&mdash;this long and wasting heart-martyrdom, this slow, daily bleeding away of the inward life, drop by drop, hour after hour,&mdash;this is the true searching test of what there may be in man or woman.</p><p>When Tom stood face to face with his persecutor, and heard his threats, and thought in his very soul that his hour was come, his heart swelled bravely in him, and he thought he could bear torture and fire, bear anything, with the vision of Jesus and heaven but just a step beyond; but, when he was gone, and the present excitement passed off, came back the pain of his bruised and weary limbs,&mdash;came back the sense of his utterly degraded, hopeless, forlorn estate; and the day passed wearily enough.</p></div> </div>
