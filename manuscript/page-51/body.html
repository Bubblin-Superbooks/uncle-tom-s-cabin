<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It was during the happy period of his employment in the factory that George had seen and married his wife. During that period,&mdash;being much trusted and favored by his employer,&mdash;he had free liberty to come and go at discretion. The marriage was highly approved of by Mrs. Shelby, who, with a little womanly complacency in match-making, felt pleased to unite her handsome favorite with one of her own class who seemed in every way suited to her; and so they were married in her mistress&rsquo; great parlor, and her mistress herself adorned the bride&rsquo;s beautiful hair with orange-blossoms, and threw over it the bridal veil, which certainly could scarce have rested on a fairer head; and there was no lack of white gloves, and cake and wine,&mdash;of admiring guests to praise the bride&rsquo;s beauty, and her mistress&rsquo; indulgence and liberality.</p></div> </div>
