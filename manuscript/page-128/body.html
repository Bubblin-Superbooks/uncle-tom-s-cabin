We don&rsquo;t need them to tell us; you know I never thought that slavery was right&mdash;never felt willing to own slaves.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, therein you differ from many wise and pious men,&rdquo; said Mr. Shelby. &ldquo;You remember Mr. B.&lsquo;s sermon, the other Sunday?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hear such sermons; I never wish to hear Mr. B. in our church again. Ministers can&rsquo;t help the evil, perhaps,&mdash;can&rsquo;t cure it, any more than we can,&mdash;but defend it!&mdash;it always went against my common sense. And I think you didn&rsquo;t think much of that sermon, either.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
