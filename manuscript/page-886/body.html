I really wanted you to try with one child, who is a specimen of thousands among us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is your system makes such children,&rdquo; said Miss Ophelia.</p><p>&ldquo;I know it; but they are made,&mdash;they exist,&mdash;and what is to be done with them?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t say I thank you for the experiment. But, then, as it appears to be a duty, I shall persevere and try, and do the best I can,&rdquo; said Miss Ophelia; and Miss Ophelia, after this, did labor, with a commendable degree of zeal and energy, on her new subject.
