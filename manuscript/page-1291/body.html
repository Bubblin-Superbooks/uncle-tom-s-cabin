<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;O, good Lord! Do look down,&mdash;give me the victory!&mdash;give me the victory over all!&rdquo; prayed poor Tom, in his anguish.</p><p>A footstep entered the room, behind him, and the light of a lantern flashed on his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there? O, for the Lord&rsquo;s massy, please give me some water!&rdquo;</p><p>The woman Cassy&mdash;for it was she,&mdash;set down her lantern, and, pouring water from a bottle, raised his head, and gave him drink. Another and another cup were drained, with feverish eagerness.</p><p>&ldquo;Drink all ye want,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I knew how it would be. It isn&rsquo;t the first time I&rsquo;ve been out in the night, carrying water to such as you.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
