She would walk straight down into a well, or up to a loaded cannon&rsquo;s mouth, if she were only quite sure that there the path lay. Her standard of right was so high, so all-embracing, so minute, and making so few concessions to human frailty, that, though she strove with heroic ardor to reach it, she never actually did so, and of course was burdened with a constant and often harassing sense of deficiency;&mdash;this gave a severe and somewhat gloomy cast to her religious character.</p></div> </div>
