Every one will run out of the house to look after us, and then we&rsquo;ll whip in at the back door, and up into the garret, where I&rsquo;ve got a nice bed made up in one of the great boxes.

He&rsquo;ll muster some of those old overseers on the other plantations, and have a great hunt; and they&rsquo;ll go over every inch of ground in that swamp. He makes it his boast that nobody ever got away from him. So let him hunt at his leisure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cassy, how well you have planned it!&rdquo; said Emmeline. &ldquo;Who ever would have thought of it, but you?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
