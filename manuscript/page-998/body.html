<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I ought to know such things, I ought to feel about them! Such things always sunk into my heart; they went down deep; I&rsquo;ve thought and thought about them. Papa, isn&rsquo;t there any way to have all slaves made free?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a difficult question, dearest. There&rsquo;s no doubt that this way is a very bad one; a great many people think so; I do myself I heartily wish that there were not a slave in the land; but, then, I don&rsquo;t know what is to be done about it!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Papa, you are such a good man, and so noble, and kind, and you always have a way of saying things that is so pleasant, couldn&rsquo;t you go all round and try to persuade people to do right about this? When I am dead, papa, then you will think of me, and do it for my sake. I would do it, if I could.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
