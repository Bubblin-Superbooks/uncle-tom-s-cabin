<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. One thing is certain,&mdash;that there is a mustering among the masses, the world over; and there is a dies ir&aelig; coming on, sooner or later. The same thing is working in Europe, in England, and in this country. My mother used to tell me of a millennium that was coming, when Christ should reign, and all men should be free and happy. And she taught me, when I was a boy, to pray, &rsquo;thy kingdom come.&rsquo; Sometimes I think all this sighing, and groaning, and stirring among the dry bones foretells what she used to tell me was coming. But who may abide the day of His appearing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Augustine, sometimes I think you are not far from the kingdom,&rdquo; said Miss Ophelia, laying down her knitting, and looking anxiously at her cousin.</p></div> </div>
