I&rsquo;ve learnt to write some. Last year I could make all the letters, but I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve forgotten.&rdquo;</p><p>So Eva put her golden head close to his, and the two commenced a grave and anxious discussion, each one equally earnest, and about equally ignorant; and, with a deal of consulting and advising over every word, the composition began, as they both felt very sanguine, to look quite like writing.</p></div> </div>
