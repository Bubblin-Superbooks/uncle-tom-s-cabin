The establishment was, of a consequence, wholly deserted, when Cassy and Emmeline glided into it the back way. The whooping and shouts of their pursuers were still filling the air; and, looking from the sitting-room windows, Cassy and Emmeline could see the troop, with their flambeaux, just dispersing themselves along the edge of the swamp.</p><p>&ldquo;See there!&rdquo; said Emmeline, pointing to Cassy; &ldquo;the hunt is begun! Look how those lights dance about! Hark! the dogs! Don&rsquo;t you hear? If we were only there, our chances wouldn&rsquo;t be worth a picayune. O, for pity&rsquo;s sake, do let&rsquo;s hide ourselves. Quick!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
