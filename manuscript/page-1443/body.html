<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Legree had been casting up accounts and reading newspapers for some hours, while Cassy sat in the corner; sullenly looking into the fire. Legree laid down his paper, and seeing an old book lying on the table, which he had noticed Cassy reading, the first part of the evening, took it up, and began to turn it over. It was one of those collections of stories of bloody murders, ghostly legends, and supernatural visitations, which, coarsely got up and illustrated, have a strange fascination for one who once begins to read them.</p><p>Legree poohed and pished, but read, turning page after page, till, finally, after reading some way, he threw down the book, with an oath.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe in ghosts, do you, Cass?&rdquo; said he, taking the tongs and settling the fire. &ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d more sense than to let noises scare you.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
