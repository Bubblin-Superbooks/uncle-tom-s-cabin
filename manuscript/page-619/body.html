<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Miss Ophelia, bluntly, &ldquo;I suppose you think your servants are human creatures, and ought to have some rest when they are tired.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Certainly, of course. I&rsquo;m very particular in letting them have everything that comes convenient,&mdash;anything that doesn&rsquo;t put one at all out of the way, you know. Mammy can make up her sleep, some time or other; there&rsquo;s no difficulty about that. She&rsquo;s the sleepiest concern that ever I saw; sewing, standing, or sitting, that creature will go to sleep, and sleep anywhere and everywhere. No danger but Mammy gets sleep enough. But this treating servants as if they were exotic flowers, or china vases, is really ridiculous,&rdquo; said Marie, as she plunged languidly into the depths of a voluminous and pillowy lounge, and drew towards her an elegant cut-glass vinaigrette.</p></div> </div>
