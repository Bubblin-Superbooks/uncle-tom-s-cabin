<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Tom looked up to the silent, ever-living stars,&mdash;types of the angelic hosts who ever look down on man; and the solitude of the night rung with the triumphant words of a hymn, which he had sung often in happier days, but never with such feeling as now:</p><p>&ldquo;The earth shall be dissolved like snow, The sun shall cease to shine; But God, who called me here below, Shall be forever mine. &ldquo;And when this mortal life shall fail, And flesh and sense shall cease, I shall possess within the veil A life of joy and peace. &ldquo;When we&rsquo;ve been there ten thousand years, Bright shining like the sun, We&rsquo;ve no less days to sing God&rsquo;s praise Than when we first begun.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
