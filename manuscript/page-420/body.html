No matter how kind her mistress is,&mdash;no matter how much she loves her home; beg her not to go back,&mdash;for slavery always ends in misery. Tell her to bring up our boy a free man, and then he won&rsquo;t suffer as I have. Tell her this, Mr. Wilson, will you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, George. I&rsquo;ll tell her; but I trust you won&rsquo;t die; take heart,&mdash;you&rsquo;re a brave fellow. Trust in the Lord, George. I wish in my heart you were safe through, though,&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I do.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
