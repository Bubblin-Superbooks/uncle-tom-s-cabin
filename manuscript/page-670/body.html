I can do dress-making very well; and I understand fine washing and ironing; and between us we can find something to live on.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Eliza, so long as we have each other and our boy. O! Eliza, if these people only knew what a blessing it is for a man to feel that his wife and child belong to him!
