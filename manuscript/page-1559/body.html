<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> When I wander, her gentler spirit ever restores me, and keeps before my eyes the Christian calling and mission of our race. As a Christian patriot, as a teacher of Christianity, I go to my country,&mdash;my chosen, my glorious Africa!&mdash;and to her, in my heart, I sometimes apply those splendid words of prophecy: &rsquo;Whereas thou hast been forsaken and hated, so that no man went through thee; I will make thee an eternal excellence, a joy of many generations!&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You will call me an enthusiast: you will tell me that I have not well considered what I am undertaking. But I have considered, and counted the cost. I go to Liberia, not as an Elysium of romance, but as to a field of work. I expect to work with both hands,&mdash;to work hard; to work against all sorts of difficulties and discouragements; and to work till I die. This is what I go for; and in this I am quite sure I shall not be disappointed.</p></div> </div>
