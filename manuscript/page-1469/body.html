<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> We have walked with our humble friend thus far in the valley of slavery; first through flowery fields of ease and indulgence, then through heart-breaking separations from all that man holds dear. Again, we have waited with him in a sunny island, where generous hands concealed his chains with flowers; and, lastly, we have followed him when the last ray of earthly hope went out in night, and seen how, in the blackness of earthly darkness, the firmament of the unseen has blazed with stars of new and significant lustre.</p><p>The morning-star now stands over the tops of the mountains, and gales and breezes, not of earth, show that the gates of day are unclosing.</p></div> </div>
