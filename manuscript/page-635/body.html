<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I make no manner of doubt that you threw a very diamond of truth at me, though you see it hit me so directly in the face that it wasn&rsquo;t exactly appreciated, at first.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For my part, I don&rsquo;t see any use in such sort of talk,&rdquo; said Marie. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure, if anybody does more for servants than we do, I&rsquo;d like to know who; and it don&rsquo;t do &rsquo;em a bit good,&mdash;not a particle,&mdash;they get worse and worse. As to talking to them, or anything like that, I&rsquo;m sure I have talked till I was tired and hoarse, telling them their duty, and all that; and I&rsquo;m sure they can go to church when they like, though they don&rsquo;t understand a word of the sermon, more than so many pigs,&mdash;so it isn&rsquo;t of any great use for them to go, as I see; but they do go, and so they have every chance;</p></div> </div>
