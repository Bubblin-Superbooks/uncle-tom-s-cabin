The poor soul had expended all her little energies on this farewell feast,&mdash;had killed and dressed her choicest chicken, and prepared her corn-cake with scrupulous exactness, just to her husband&rsquo;s taste, and brought out certain mysterious jars on the mantel-piece, some preserves that were never produced except on extreme occasions.</p><p>&ldquo;Lor, Pete,&rdquo; said Mose, triumphantly, &ldquo;han&rsquo;t we got a buster of a breakfast!&rdquo; at the same time catching at a fragment of the chicken.</p><p>Aunt Chloe gave him a sudden box on the ear. &ldquo;Thar now! crowing over the last breakfast yer poor daddy&rsquo;s gwine to have to home!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
