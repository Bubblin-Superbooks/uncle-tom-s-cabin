<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;My country again! Mr. Wilson, you have a country; but what country have I, or any one like me, born of slave mothers? What laws are there for us? We don&rsquo;t make them,&mdash;we don&rsquo;t consent to them,&mdash;we have nothing to do with them; all they do for us is to crush us, and keep us down. Haven&rsquo;t I heard your Fourth-of-July speeches? Don&rsquo;t you tell us all, once a year, that governments derive their just power from the consent of the governed? Can&rsquo;t a fellow think, that hears such things? Can&rsquo;t he put this and that together, and see what it comes to?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
