O!&rdquo; She laid her hand on her breast and drew in her breath, as if to lift a heavy weight.</p><p>Tom looked as if he would speak again; but she cut him short, with a decided gesture.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk, my poor fellow. Try to sleep, if you can.&rdquo; And, placing water in his reach, and making whatever little arrangements for his comforts she could, Cassy left the shed.</p></div> </div>
