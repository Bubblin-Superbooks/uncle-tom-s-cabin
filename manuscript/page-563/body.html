<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> In the family &ldquo;keeping-room,&rdquo; as it is termed, he will remember the staid, respectable old book-case, with its glass doors, where Rollin&rsquo;s History,* Milton&rsquo;s Paradise Lost, Bunyan&rsquo;s Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress, and Scott&rsquo;s Family Bible,** stand side by side in decorous order, with multitudes of other books, equally solemn and respectable. There are no servants in the house, but the lady in the snowy cap, with the spectacles, who sits sewing every afternoon among her daughters, as if nothing ever had been done, or were to be done,&mdash;she and her girls, in some long-forgotten fore part of the day, &ldquo;did up the work,&rdquo; and for the rest of the time, probably, at all hours when you would see them, it is &ldquo;done up.</p></div> </div>
