This had been a conceded point with her old mistress, Marie&rsquo;s mother; and &ldquo;Miss Marie,&rdquo; as Dinah always called her young mistress, even after her marriage, found it easier to submit than contend; and so Dinah had ruled supreme. This was the easier, in that she was perfect mistress of that diplomatic art which unites the utmost subservience of manner with the utmost inflexibility as to measure.</p></div> </div>
