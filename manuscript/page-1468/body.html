Though life its common gifts deny,&mdash; Though, with a crushed and bleeding heart, And spurned of man, he goes to die! For God hath marked each sorrowing day, And numbered every bitter tear, And heaven&rsquo;s long years of bliss shall pay For all his children suffer here.&rdquo; BRYANT.*</p><p>* This poem does not appear in the collected works of William Cullen Bryant, nor in the collected poems of his brother, John Howard Bryant. It was probably copied from a newspaper or magazine.</p><p>The longest way must have its close,&mdash;the gloomiest night will wear on to a morning. An eternal, inexorable lapse of moments is ever hurrying the day of the evil to an eternal night, and the night of the just to an eternal day.</p></div> </div>
