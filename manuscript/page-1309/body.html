<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I wanted only one thing&mdash;I did want him to marry me. I thought, if he loved me as he said he did, and if I was what he seemed to think I was, he would be willing to marry me and set me free. But he convinced me that it would be impossible; and he told me that, if we were only faithful to each other, it was marriage before God. If that is true, wasn&rsquo;t I that man&rsquo;s wife? Wasn&rsquo;t I faithful? For seven years, didn&rsquo;t I study every look and motion, and only live and breathe to please him? He had the yellow fever, and for twenty days and nights I watched with him. I alone,&mdash;and gave him all his medicine, and did everything for him; and then he called me his good angel, and said I&rsquo;d saved his life. We had two beautiful children. The first was a boy, and we called him Henry.</p></div> </div>
