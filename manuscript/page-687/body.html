<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Friend George,&rdquo; said Simeon, from the kitchen, &ldquo;listen to this Psalm; it may do thee good.&rdquo;</p><p>George drew his seat near the door, and Eliza, wiping her tears, came forward also to listen, while Simeon read as follows:</p><p>&ldquo;But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well-nigh slipped. For I was envious of the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked. They are not in trouble like other men, neither are they plagued like other men. Therefore, pride compasseth them as a chain; violence covereth them as a garment. Their eyes stand out with fatness; they have more than heart could wish. They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression; they speak loftily. Therefore his people return, and the waters of a full cup are wrung out to them, and they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the Most High?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
