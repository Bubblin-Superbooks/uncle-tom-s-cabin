There isn&rsquo;t, on earth, a living soul to care if I die,&rdquo; he added, drawing his breath hard, and speaking with a great effort,&mdash;&ldquo;I shall be kicked out and buried like a dog, and nobody&rsquo;ll think of it a day after,&mdash;only my poor wife! Poor soul! she&rsquo;ll mourn and grieve; and if you&rsquo;d only contrive, Mr. Wilson, to send this little pin to her. She gave it to me for a Christmas present, poor child! Give it to her, and tell her I loved her to the last. Will you? Will you?&rdquo; he added, earnestly.</p></div> </div>
