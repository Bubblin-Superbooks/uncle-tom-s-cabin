<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Topsy was soon a noted character in the establishment. Her talent for every species of drollery, grimace, and mimicry,&mdash;for dancing, tumbling, climbing, singing, whistling, imitating every sound that hit her fancy,&mdash;seemed inexhaustible. In her play-hours, she invariably had every child in the establishment at her heels, open-mouthed with admiration and wonder,&mdash;not excepting Miss Eva, who appeared to be fascinated by her wild diablerie, as a dove is sometimes charmed by a glittering serpent. Miss Ophelia was uneasy that Eva should fancy Topsy&rsquo;s society so much, and implored St. Clare to forbid it.</p><p>&ldquo;Poh! let the child alone,&rdquo; said St. Clare. &ldquo;Topsy will do her good.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
