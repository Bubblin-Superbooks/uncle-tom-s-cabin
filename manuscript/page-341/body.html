<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The February morning looked gray and drizzling through the window of Uncle Tom&rsquo;s cabin. It looked on downcast faces, the images of mournful hearts. The little table stood out before the fire, covered with an ironing-cloth; a coarse but clean shirt or two, fresh from the iron, hung on the back of a chair by the fire, and Aunt Chloe had another spread out before her on the table. Carefully she rubbed and ironed every fold and every hem, with the most scrupulous exactness, every now and then raising her hand to her face to wipe off the tears that were coursing down her cheeks.</p><p>Tom sat by, with his Testament open on his knee, and his head leaning upon his hand;&mdash;but neither spoke. It was yet early, and the children lay all asleep together in their little rude trundle-bed.</p></div> </div>
