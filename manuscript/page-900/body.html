Augustine, be still,&rdquo; said Miss Ophelia; &ldquo;how can I do anything, if you will be laughing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t disturb the exercises again, on my honor;&rdquo; and St. Clare took his paper into the parlor, and sat down, till Topsy had finished her recitations. They were all very well, only that now and then she would oddly transpose some important words, and persist in the mistake, in spite of every effort to the contrary; and St. Clare, after all his promises of goodness, took a wicked pleasure in these mistakes, calling Topsy to him whenever he had a mind to amuse himself, and getting her to repeat the offending passages, in spite of Miss Ophelia&rsquo;s remonstrances.</p></div> </div>
