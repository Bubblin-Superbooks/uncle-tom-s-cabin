<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;O, Lord, have mercy!&rdquo; said Eliza, sobbing. &ldquo;If he will only let us get out of this country together, that is all we ask.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is God on their side?&rdquo; said George, speaking less to his wife than pouring out his own bitter thoughts. &ldquo;Does he see all they do? Why does he let such things happen? And they tell us that the Bible is on their side; certainly all the power is. They are rich, and healthy, and happy; they are members of churches, expecting to go to heaven; and they get along so easy in the world, and have it all their own way; and poor, honest, faithful Christians,&mdash;Christians as good or better than they,&mdash;are lying in the very dust under their feet. They buy &rsquo;em and sell &rsquo;em, and make trade of their heart&rsquo;s blood, and groans and tears,&mdash;and God lets them.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
