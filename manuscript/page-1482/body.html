I can die!&rdquo;</p><p>Legree drew in a long breath; and, suppressing his rage, took Tom by the arm, and, approaching his face almost to his, said, in a terrible voice, &ldquo;Hark &rsquo;e, Tom!&mdash;ye think, &rsquo;cause I&rsquo;ve let you off before, I don&rsquo;t mean what I say; but, this time, I&rsquo;ve made up my mind, and counted the cost. You&rsquo;ve always stood it out again&rsquo; me: now, I&rsquo;ll conquer ye, or kill ye!&mdash;one or t&rsquo; other. I&rsquo;ll count every drop of blood there is in you, and take &rsquo;em, one by one, till ye give up!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
