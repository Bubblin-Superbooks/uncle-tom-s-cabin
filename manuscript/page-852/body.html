The expression of her face was an odd mixture of shrewdness and cunning, over which was oddly drawn, like a kind of veil, an expression of the most doleful gravity and solemnity. She was dressed in a single filthy, ragged garment, made of bagging; and stood with her hands demurely folded before her. Altogether, there was something odd and goblin-like about her appearance,&mdash;something, as Miss Ophelia afterwards said, &ldquo;so heathenish,&rdquo; as to inspire that good lady with utter dismay; and turning to St. Clare, she said,</p><p>&ldquo;Augustine, what in the world have you brought that thing here for?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
