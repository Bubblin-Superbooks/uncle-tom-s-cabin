<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Marie lay back on a lounge, and covered her face with her cambric handkerchief.</p><p>Eva&rsquo;s clear blue eye looked earnestly from one to the other. It was the calm, comprehending gaze of a soul half loosed from its earthly bonds; it was evident she saw, felt, and appreciated, the difference between the two.</p><p>She beckoned with her hand to her father. He came and sat down by her.</p><p>&ldquo;Papa, my strength fades away every day, and I know I must go. There are some things I want to say and do,&mdash;that I ought to do; and you are so unwilling to have me speak a word on this subject. But it must come; there&rsquo;s no putting it off. Do be willing I should speak now!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
