<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Mother, I don&rsquo;t need to keep awake, do I?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, my darling; sleep, if you want to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But, mother, if I do get asleep, you won&rsquo;t let him get me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No! so may God help me!&rdquo; said his mother, with a paler cheek, and a brighter light in her large dark eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure, an&rsquo;t you, mother?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, sure!&rdquo; said the mother, in a voice that startled herself; for it seemed to her to come from a spirit within, that was no part of her; and the boy dropped his little weary head on her shoulder, and was soon asleep. How the touch of those warm arms, the gentle breathings that came in her neck, seemed to add fire and spirit to her movements!</p></div> </div>
