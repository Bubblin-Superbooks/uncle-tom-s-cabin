<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I dare say you would,&mdash;you are one of the doing sort,&mdash;but what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, elevate your own servants, for a specimen,&rdquo; said Alfred, with a half-scornful smile.</p><p>&ldquo;You might as well set Mount &AElig;tna on them flat, and tell them to stand up under it, as tell me to elevate my servants under all the superincumbent mass of society upon them. One man can do nothing, against the whole action of a community. Education, to do anything, must be a state education; or there must be enough agreed in it to make a current.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You take the first throw,&rdquo; said Alfred; and the brothers were soon lost in the game, and heard no more till the scraping of horses&rsquo; feet was heard under the verandah.</p></div> </div>
