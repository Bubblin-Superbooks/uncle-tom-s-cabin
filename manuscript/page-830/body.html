<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;My dear cousin, can you be satisfied with such a way of spending your probation?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Satisfied! Was I not just telling you I despised it? But, then, to come back to this point,&mdash;we were on this liberation business. I don&rsquo;t think my feelings about slavery are peculiar. I find many men who, in their hearts, think of it just as I do. The land groans under it; and, bad as it is for the slave, it is worse, if anything, for the master. It takes no spectacles to see that a great class of vicious, improvident, degraded people, among us, are an evil to us, as well as to themselves. The capitalist and aristocrat of England cannot feel that as we do, because they do not mingle with the class they degrade as we do.</p></div> </div>
