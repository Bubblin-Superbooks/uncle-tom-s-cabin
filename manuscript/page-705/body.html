<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;We want a party of runaway niggers,&rdquo; said Tom Loker. &ldquo;One George Harris, and Eliza Harris, and their son, and Jim Selden, and an old woman. We&rsquo;ve got the officers, here, and a warrant to take &rsquo;em; and we&rsquo;re going to have &rsquo;em, too. D&rsquo;ye hear? An&rsquo;t you George Harris, that belongs to Mr. Harris, of Shelby county, Kentucky?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am George Harris. A Mr. Harris, of Kentucky, did call me his property. But now I&rsquo;m a free man, standing on God&rsquo;s free soil; and my wife and my child I claim as mine. Jim and his mother are here. We have arms to defend ourselves, and we mean to do it. You can come up, if you like; but the first one of you that comes within the range of our bullets is a dead man, and the next, and the next; and so on till the last.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
