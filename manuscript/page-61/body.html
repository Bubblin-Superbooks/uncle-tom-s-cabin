<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Well, it is dreadful,&rdquo; said Eliza; &ldquo;but, after all, he is your master, you know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My master! and who made him my master? That&rsquo;s what I think of&mdash;what right has he to me? I&rsquo;m a man as much as he is. I&rsquo;m a better man than he is. I know more about business than he does; I am a better manager than he is; I can read better than he can; I can write a better hand,&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve learned it all myself, and no thanks to him,&mdash;I&rsquo;ve learned it in spite of him; and now what right has he to make a dray-horse of me?&mdash;to take me from things I can do, and do better than he can, and put me to work that any horse can do? He tries to do it; he says he&rsquo;ll bring me down and humble me, and he puts me to just the hardest, meanest and dirtiest work, on purpose!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
