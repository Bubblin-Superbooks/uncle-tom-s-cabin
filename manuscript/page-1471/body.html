<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>When Legree returned, baffled and disappointed, all the long-working hatred of his soul towards his slave began to gather in a deadly and desperate form. Had not this man braved him,&mdash;steadily, powerfully, resistlessly,&mdash;ever since he bought him? Was there not a spirit in him which, silent as it was, burned on him like the fires of perdition?</p><p>&ldquo;I hate him!&rdquo; said Legree, that night, as he sat up in his bed; &ldquo;I hate him! And isn&rsquo;t he MINE? Can&rsquo;t I do what I like with him? Who&rsquo;s to hinder, I wonder?&rdquo; And Legree clenched his fist, and shook it, as if he had something in his hands that he could rend in pieces.</p></div> </div>
