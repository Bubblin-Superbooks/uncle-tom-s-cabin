<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Dinah was mistress of the whole art and mystery of excuse-making, in all its branches. Indeed, it was an axiom with her that the cook can do no wrong; and a cook in a Southern kitchen finds abundance of heads and shoulders on which to lay off every sin and frailty, so as to maintain her own immaculateness entire. If any part of the dinner was a failure, there were fifty indisputably good reasons for it; and it was the fault undeniably of fifty other people, whom Dinah berated with unsparing zeal.</p><p>But it was very seldom that there was any failure in Dinah&rsquo;s last results. Though her mode of doing everything was peculiarly meandering and circuitous, and without any sort of calculation as to time and place,&mdash;though her kitchen generally looked as if it had been arranged by a hurricane blowing through it, and she had about as many places for each cooking utensil as there were days in the year,&mdash;</p></div> </div>
