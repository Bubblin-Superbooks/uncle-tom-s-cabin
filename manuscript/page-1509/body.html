He sulkily followed them to where the wagon stood at the door.</p><p>George spread his cloak in the wagon, and had the body carefully disposed of in it,&mdash;moving the seat, so as to give it room. Then he turned, fixed his eyes on Legree, and said, with forced composure,</p><p>&ldquo;I have not, as yet, said to you what I think of this most atrocious affair;&mdash;this is not the time and place. But, sir, this innocent blood shall have justice. I will proclaim this murder. I will go to the very first magistrate, and expose you.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
