<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Why, Eva, child, don&rsquo;t you think they are well enough off now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;O, but, papa, if anything should happen to you, what would become of them? There are very few men like you, papa. Uncle Alfred isn&rsquo;t like you, and mamma isn&rsquo;t; and then, think of poor old Prue&rsquo;s owners! What horrid things people do, and can do!&rdquo; and Eva shuddered.</p><p>&ldquo;My dear child, you are too sensitive. I&rsquo;m sorry I ever let you hear such stories.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;O, that&rsquo;s what troubles me, papa. You want me to live so happy, and never to have any pain,&mdash;never suffer anything,&mdash;not even hear a sad story, when other poor creatures have nothing but pain and sorrow, all their lives;&mdash;it seems selfish.</p></div> </div>
