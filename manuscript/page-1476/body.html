<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Poor Cassy!&rdquo; said Emmeline, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t feel so! If the Lord gives us liberty, perhaps he&rsquo;ll give you back your daughter; at any rate, I&rsquo;ll be like a daughter to you. I know I&rsquo;ll never see my poor old mother again! I shall love you, Cassy, whether you love me or not!&rdquo;</p><p>The gentle, child-like spirit conquered. Cassy sat down by her, put her arm round her neck, stroked her soft, brown hair; and Emmeline then wondered at the beauty of her magnificent eyes, now soft with tears.</p><p>&ldquo;O, Em!&rdquo; said Cassy, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve hungered for my children, and thirsted for them, and my eyes fail with longing for them! Here! here!&rdquo; she said, striking her breast, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all desolate, all empty! If God would give me back my children, then I could pray.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
