She laid her head down between her knees, and wept and sobbed,&mdash;while the beautiful child, bending over her, looked like the picture of some bright angel stooping to reclaim a sinner.</p><p>&ldquo;Poor Topsy!&rdquo; said Eva, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you know that Jesus loves all alike? He is just as willing to love you, as me. He loves you just as I do,&mdash;only more, because he is better. He will help you to be good; and you can go to Heaven at last, and be an angel forever, just as much as if you were white. Only think of it, Topsy!&mdash;you can be one of those spirits bright, Uncle Tom sings about.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
