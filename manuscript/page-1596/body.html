<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Christian men and women of the North! still further,&mdash;you have another power; you can pray! Do you believe in prayer? or has it become an indistinct apostolic tradition? You pray for the heathen abroad; pray also for the heathen at home. And pray for those distressed Christians whose whole chance of religious improvement is an accident of trade and sale; from whom any adherence to the morals of Christianity is, in many cases, an impossibility, unless they have given them, from above, the courage and grace of martyrdom.</p><p>But, still more. On the shores of our free states are emerging the poor, shattered, broken remnants of families,&mdash;men and women, escaped, by miraculous providences from the surges of slavery,&mdash;feeble in knowledge, and, in many cases, infirm in moral constitution, from a system which confounds and confuses every principle of Christianity and morality. They come to seek a refuge among you; they come to seek education, knowledge, Christianity.</p></div> </div>
