<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Sons trained like your Henrique will be grand guardians of your powder-magazines,&rdquo; said Augustine,&mdash;&ldquo;so cool and self-possessed! The proverb says, &rsquo;They that cannot govern themselves cannot govern others.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is a trouble there&rdquo; said Alfred, thoughtfully; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no doubt that our system is a difficult one to train children under. It gives too free scope to the passions, altogether, which, in our climate, are hot enough. I find trouble with Henrique. The boy is generous and warm-hearted, but a perfect fire-cracker when excited. I believe I shall send him North for his education, where obedience is more fashionable, and where he will associate more with equals, and less with dependents.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
