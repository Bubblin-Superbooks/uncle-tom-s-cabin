Now, I&rsquo;m a lost soul, pursued by devils that torment me day and night; they keep pushing me on and on&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll do it, too, some of these days!&rdquo; she said, clenching her hand, while an insane light glanced in her heavy black eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send him where he belongs,&mdash;a short way, too,&mdash;one of these nights, if they burn me alive for it!&rdquo; A wild, long laugh rang through the deserted room, and ended in a hysteric sob; she threw herself on the floor, in convulsive sobbing and struggles.</p><p>In a few moments, the frenzy fit seemed to pass off; she rose slowly, and seemed to collect herself.</p></div> </div>
