<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Friend Phineas will ever have ways of his own,&rdquo; said Rachel Halliday, smiling; &ldquo;but we all think that his heart is in the right place, after all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said George, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it best that we hasten our flight?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I got up at four o&rsquo;clock, and came on with all speed, full two or three hours ahead of them, if they start at the time they planned. It isn&rsquo;t safe to start till dark, at any rate; for there are some evil persons in the villages ahead, that might be disposed to meddle with us, if they saw our wagon, and that would delay us more than the waiting; but in two hours I think we may venture. I will go over to Michael Cross, and engage him to come behind on his swift nag, and keep a bright lookout on the road, and warn us if any company of men come on.</p></div> </div>
