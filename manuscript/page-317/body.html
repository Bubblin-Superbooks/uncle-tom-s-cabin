<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Why not? Cudjoe is an excellent driver.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, but here it is. The creek has to be crossed twice; and the second crossing is quite dangerous, unless one knows it as I do. I have crossed it a hundred times on horseback, and know exactly the turns to take. And so, you see, there&rsquo;s no help for it. Cudjoe must put in the horses, as quietly as may be, about twelve o&rsquo;clock, and I&rsquo;ll take her over; and then, to give color to the matter, he must carry me on to the next tavern to take the stage for Columbus, that comes by about three or four, and so it will look as if I had had the carriage only for that. I shall get into business bright and early in the morning.</p></div> </div>
