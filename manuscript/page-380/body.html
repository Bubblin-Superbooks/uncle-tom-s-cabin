<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>the outer door and every window being set wide open, and the calico window-curtain flopping and snapping in a good stiff breeze of damp raw air,&mdash;and you have an idea of the jollities of a Kentucky tavern.</p><p>Your Kentuckian of the present day is a good illustration of the doctrine of transmitted instincts and peculiarities. His fathers were mighty hunters,&mdash;men who lived in the woods, and slept under the free, open heavens, with the stars to hold their candles; and their descendant to this day always acts as if the house were his camp,&mdash;wears his hat at all hours, tumbles himself about, and puts his heels on the tops of chairs or mantelpieces, just as his father rolled on the green sward, and put his upon trees and logs,&mdash;keeps all the windows and doors open, winter and summer, that he may get air enough for his great lungs,&mdash;calls everybody &ldquo;stranger,&rdquo; with nonchalant bonhommie, and is altogether the frankest, easiest, most jovial creature living.</p></div> </div>
