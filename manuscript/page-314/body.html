<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I say, wife, she&rsquo;ll have to get away from here, this very night. That fellow will be down on the scent bright and early tomorrow morning: if &rsquo;t was only the woman, she could lie quiet till it was over; but that little chap can&rsquo;t be kept still by a troop of horse and foot, I&rsquo;ll warrant me; he&rsquo;ll bring it all out, popping his head out of some window or door. A pretty kettle of fish it would be for me, too, to be caught with them both here, just now! No; they&rsquo;ll have to be got off tonight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tonight! How is it possible?&mdash;where to?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
