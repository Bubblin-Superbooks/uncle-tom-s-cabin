<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It is one of the bitterest apportionments of a lot of slavery, that the negro, sympathetic and assimilative, after acquiring, in a refined family, the tastes and feelings which form the atmosphere of such a place, is not the less liable to become the bond-slave of the coarsest and most brutal,&mdash;just as a chair or table, which once decorated the superb saloon, comes, at last, battered and defaced, to the barroom of some filthy tavern, or some low haunt of vulgar debauchery. The great difference is, that the table and chair cannot feel, and the man can; for even a legal enactment that he shall be &ldquo;taken, reputed, adjudged in law, to be a chattel personal,&rdquo; cannot blot out his soul, with its own private little world of memories, hopes, loves, fears, and desires.</p></div> </div>
