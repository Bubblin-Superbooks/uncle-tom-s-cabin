Utmost agony, woe, degradation, want, and loss of all things, shall only hasten on the process by which he shall be made a king and a priest unto God!</p><p>From this time, an inviolable sphere of peace encompassed the lowly heart of the oppressed one,&mdash;an ever-present Saviour hallowed it as a temple.
