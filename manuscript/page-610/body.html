They were little dirty things&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t have them about; and, besides, they took up too much of her time; but I believe that Mammy has always kept up a sort of sulkiness about this. She won&rsquo;t marry anybody else; and I do believe, now, though she knows how necessary she is to me, and how feeble my health is, she would go back to her husband tomorrow, if she only could. I do, indeed,&rdquo; said Marie; &ldquo;they are just so selfish, now, the best of them.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
