<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Cassy entered the room, and found Emmeline sitting, pale with fear, in the furthest corner of it. As she came in, the girl started up nervously; but, on seeing who it was, rushed forward, and catching her arm, said, &ldquo;O Cassy, is it you? I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;ve come! I was afraid it was&mdash;. O, you don&rsquo;t know what a horrid noise there has been, down stairs, all this evening!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I ought to know,&rdquo; said Cassy, dryly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard it often enough.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;O Cassy! do tell me,&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t we get away from this place? I don&rsquo;t care where,&mdash;into the swamp among the snakes,&mdash;anywhere! Couldn&rsquo;t we get somewhere away from here?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
