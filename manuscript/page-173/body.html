<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Like the sword of Coeur De Lion, which always blazed in the front and thickest of the battle, Sam&rsquo;s palm-leaf was to be seen everywhere when there was the least danger that a horse could be caught; there he would bear down full tilt, shouting, &ldquo;Now for it! cotch him! cotch him!&rdquo; in a way that would set everything to indiscriminate rout in a moment.</p><p>Haley ran up and down, and cursed and swore and stamped miscellaneously. Mr. Shelby in vain tried to shout directions from the balcony, and Mrs. Shelby from her chamber window alternately laughed and wondered,&mdash;not without some inkling of what lay at the bottom of all this confusion.</p></div> </div>
