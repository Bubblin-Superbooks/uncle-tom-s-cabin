<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Is it strange, then, that some tears fall on the pages of his Bible, as he lays it on the cotton-bale, and, with patient finger, threading his slow way from word to word, traces out its promises? Having learned late in life, Tom was but a slow reader, and passed on laboriously from verse to verse. Fortunate for him was it that the book he was intent on was one which slow reading cannot injure,&mdash;nay, one whose words, like ingots of gold, seem often to need to be weighed separately, that the mind may take in their priceless value. Let us follow him a moment, as, pointing to each word, and pronouncing each half aloud, he reads,</p><p>&ldquo;Let&mdash;not&mdash;your&mdash;heart&mdash;be&mdash;troubled. In&mdash;my &mdash;Father&rsquo;s&mdash;house&mdash;are&mdash;many&mdash;mansions. I&mdash;go&mdash;to&mdash;prepare&mdash;a&mdash;place&mdash;for&mdash;you.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
