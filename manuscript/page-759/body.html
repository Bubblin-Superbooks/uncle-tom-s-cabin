Don&rsquo;t I know that the rolling-pin is under her bed, and the nutmeg-grater in her pocket with her tobacco,&mdash;that there are sixty-five different sugar-bowls, one in every hole in the house,&mdash;that she washes dishes with a dinner-napkin one day, and with a fragment of an old petticoat the next? But the upshot is, she gets up glorious dinners, makes superb coffee; and you must judge her as warriors and statesmen are judged, by her success.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But the waste,&mdash;the expense!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;O, well! Lock everything you can, and keep the key. Give out by driblets, and never inquire for odds and ends,&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t best.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
