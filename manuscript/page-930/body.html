<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Nor was Eva less zealous in kind offices, in return. Though a child, she was a beautiful reader;&mdash;a fine musical ear, a quick poetic fancy, and an instinctive sympathy with what&rsquo;s grand and noble, made her such a reader of the Bible as Tom had never before heard. At first, she read to please her humble friend; but soon her own earnest nature threw out its tendrils, and wound itself around the majestic book; and Eva loved it, because it woke in her strange yearnings, and strong, dim emotions, such as impassioned, imaginative children love to feel.</p><p>The parts that pleased her most were the Revelations and the Prophecies,&mdash;parts whose dim and wondrous imagery, and fervent language, impressed her the more, that she questioned vainly of their meaning;&mdash;and she and her simple friend, the old child and the young one, felt just alike about it.</p></div> </div>
