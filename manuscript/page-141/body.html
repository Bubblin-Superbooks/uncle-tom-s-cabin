<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;The good Lord have pity on us!&rdquo; said Aunt Chloe. &ldquo;O! it don&rsquo;t seem as if it was true! What has he done, that Mas&rsquo;r should sell him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t done anything,&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t for that. Master don&rsquo;t want to sell, and Missis she&rsquo;s always good. I heard her plead and beg for us; but he told her &rsquo;t was no use; that he was in this man&rsquo;s debt, and that this man had got the power over him; and that if he didn&rsquo;t pay him off clear, it would end in his having to sell the place and all the people, and move off. Yes, I heard him say there was no choice between selling these two and selling all, the man was driving him so hard. Master said he was sorry; but oh, Missis&mdash;you ought to have heard her talk! If she an&rsquo;t a Christian and an angel, there never was one.</p></div> </div>
