He closed his eyes, but still retained his hold; for, in the gates of eternity, the black hand and the white hold each other with an equal clasp. He murmured softly to himself, at broken intervals,</p><p>&ldquo;Recordare Jesu pie&mdash; * * * * Ne me perdas&mdash;illa die Qu&aelig;rens me&mdash;sedisti lassus.&rdquo;</p><p>It was evident that the words he had been singing that evening were passing through his mind,&mdash;words of entreaty addressed to Infinite Pity. His lips moved at intervals, as parts of the hymn fell brokenly from them.</p></div> </div>
