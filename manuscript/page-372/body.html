I always was proud of it before;&rdquo; and George sat very straight on his horse, and looked round with an air, as if he expected the state would be impressed with his opinion.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, good-by, Uncle Tom; keep a stiff upper lip,&rdquo; said George.</p><p>&ldquo;Good-by, Mas&rsquo;r George,&rdquo; said Tom, looking fondly and admiringly at him. &ldquo;God Almighty bless you! Ah! Kentucky han&rsquo;t got many like you!&rdquo; he said, in the fulness of his heart, as the frank, boyish face was lost to his view. Away he went, and Tom looked, till the clatter of his horse&rsquo;s heels died away, the last sound or sight of his home.</p></div> </div>
