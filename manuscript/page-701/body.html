Phineas easily leaped the chasm, and sat down the boy on a smooth, flat platform of crisp white moss, that covered the top of the rock.</p><p>&ldquo;Over with you!&rdquo; he called; &ldquo;spring, now, once, for your lives!&rdquo; said he, as one after another sprang across. Several fragments of loose stone formed a kind of breast-work, which sheltered their position from the observation of those below.</p></div> </div>
