Go in and attend to your muslins.&rdquo;</p><p>Our friend Tom, who had been in the kitchen during the conversation with the old rusk-woman, had followed her out into the street. He saw her go on, giving every once in a while a suppressed groan. At last she set her basket down on a doorstep, and began arranging the old, faded shawl which covered her shoulders.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll carry your basket a piece,&rdquo; said Tom, compassionately.</p><p>&ldquo;Why should ye?&rdquo; said the woman. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want no help.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
