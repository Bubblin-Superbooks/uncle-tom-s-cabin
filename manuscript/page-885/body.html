<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s more than I can say,&rdquo; said Miss Ophelia.</p><p>&ldquo;Or I either,&rdquo; said St. Clare. &ldquo;The horrid cruelties and outrages that once and a while find their way into the papers,&mdash;such cases as Prue&rsquo;s, for example,&mdash;what do they come from? In many cases, it is a gradual hardening process on both sides,&mdash;the owner growing more and more cruel, as the servant more and more callous. Whipping and abuse are like laudanum; you have to double the dose as the sensibilities decline. I saw this very early when I became an owner; and I resolved never to begin, because I did not know when I should stop,&mdash;and I resolved, at least, to protect my own moral nature. The consequence is, that my servants act like spoiled children; but I think that better than for us both to be brutalized together.</p></div> </div>
