<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Eliza, as she stood in the door, &ldquo;I saw my husband only this afternoon, and I little knew then what was to come. They have pushed him to the very last standing place, and he told me, today, that he was going to run away. Do try, if you can, to get word to him. Tell him how I went, and why I went; and tell him I&rsquo;m going to try and find Canada. You must give my love to him, and tell him, if I never see him again,&rdquo; she turned away, and stood with her back to them for a moment, and then added, in a husky voice, &ldquo;tell him to be as good as he can, and try and meet me in the kingdom of heaven.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
