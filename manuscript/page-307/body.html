I have lost a little one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then you will feel for me. I have lost two, one after another,&mdash;left &rsquo;em buried there when I came away; and I had only this one left. I never slept a night without him; he was all I had. He was my comfort and pride, day and night; and, ma&rsquo;am, they were going to take him away from me,&mdash;to sell him,&mdash;sell him down south, ma&rsquo;am, to go all alone,&mdash;</p></div> </div>
