Some low fellows, they say, said to him&mdash;Tom, why don&rsquo;t you make tracks for Canada?&rsquo; &rsquo;Ah, master trusted me, and I couldn&rsquo;t,&rsquo;&mdash;they told me about it. I am sorry to part with Tom, I must say. You ought to let him cover the whole balance of the debt; and you would, Haley, if you had any conscience.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve got just as much conscience as any man in business can afford to keep,&mdash;just a little, you know, to swear by, as &rsquo;t were,&rdquo; said the trader, jocularly; &ldquo;and, then, I&rsquo;m ready to do anything in reason to &rsquo;blige friends;</p></div> </div>
