A pretty story, truly! They are a degraded race.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think they&rsquo;ve got immortal souls?&rdquo; said Miss Ophelia, with increasing indignation.</p><p>&ldquo;O, well,&rdquo; said Marie, yawning, &ldquo;that, of course&mdash;nobody doubts that. But as to putting them on any sort of equality with us, you know, as if we could be compared, why, it&rsquo;s impossible! Now, St. Clare really has talked to me as if keeping Mammy from her husband was like keeping me from mine. There&rsquo;s no comparing in this way. Mammy couldn&rsquo;t have the feelings that I should. It&rsquo;s a different thing altogether,&mdash;of course, it is,&mdash;and yet St. Clare pretends not to see it.</p></div> </div>
