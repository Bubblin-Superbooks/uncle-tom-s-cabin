Cassy busied herself with a French book; Emmeline, overcome with the exhaustion, fell into a doze, and slept some time. She was awakened by loud shouts and outcries, the tramp of horses&rsquo; feet, and the baying of dogs. She started up, with a faint shriek.</p><p>&ldquo;Only the hunt coming back,&rdquo; said Cassy, coolly; &ldquo;never fear. Look out of this knot-hole. Don&rsquo;t you see &rsquo;em all down there? Simon has to give up, for this night. Look, how muddy his horse is, flouncing about in the swamp; the dogs, too, look rather crestfallen. Ah, my good sir, you&rsquo;ll have to try the race again and again,&mdash;the game isn&rsquo;t there.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
