<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>ETERNITY,&mdash;the word thrilled through the black man&rsquo;s soul with light and power, as he spoke; it thrilled through the sinner&rsquo;s soul, too, like the bite of a scorpion. Legree gnashed on him with his teeth, but rage kept him silent; and Tom, like a man disenthralled, spoke, in a clear and cheerful voice,</p><p>&ldquo;Mas&rsquo;r Legree, as ye bought me, I&rsquo;ll be a true and faithful servant to ye. I&rsquo;ll give ye all the work of my hands, all my time, all my strength; but my soul I won&rsquo;t give up to mortal man. I will hold on to the Lord, and put his commands before all,&mdash;die or live; you may be sure on &rsquo;t. Mas&rsquo;r Legree, I ain&rsquo;t a grain afeard to die. I&rsquo;d as soon die as not. Ye may whip me, starve me, burn me,&mdash;it&rsquo;ll only send me sooner where I want to go.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
