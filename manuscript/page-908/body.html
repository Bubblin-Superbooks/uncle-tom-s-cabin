It&rsquo;s like jumping from one bog to another, all through a swamp; borrow of one to pay another, and then borrow of another to pay one,&mdash;and these confounded notes falling due before a man has time to smoke a cigar and turn round,&mdash;dunning letters and dunning messages,&mdash;all scamper and hurry-scurry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It does seem to me, my dear, that something might be done to straighten matters. Suppose we sell off all the horses, and sell one of your farms, and pay up square?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
