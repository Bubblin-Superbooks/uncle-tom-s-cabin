<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>two front wheels go down into another abyss, and senator, woman, and child, all tumble promiscuously on to the front seat,&mdash;senator&rsquo;s hat is jammed over his eyes and nose quite unceremoniously, and he considers himself fairly extinguished;&mdash;child cries, and Cudjoe on the outside delivers animated addresses to the horses, who are kicking, and floundering, and straining under repeated cracks of the whip. Carriage springs up, with another bounce,&mdash;down go the hind wheels,&mdash;senator, woman, and child, fly over on to the back seat, his elbows encountering her bonnet, and both her feet being jammed into his hat, which flies off in the concussion. After a few moments the &ldquo;slough&rdquo; is passed, and the horses stop, panting;&mdash;the senator finds his hat, the woman straightens her bonnet and hushes her child, and they brace themselves for what is yet to come.</p></div> </div>
