She is dead and gone to Heaven; She is dead and gone to Heaven; &rsquo;Rived in the goodly land.&rdquo;</p><p>These words, sung by voices of a peculiar and melancholy sweetness, in an air which seemed like the sighing of earthy despair after heavenly hope, floated through the dark prison rooms with a pathetic cadence, as verse after verse was breathed out:</p><p>&ldquo;O, where are Paul and Silas? O, where are Paul and Silas? Gone to the goodly land. They are dead and gone to Heaven; They are dead and gone to Heaven; &rsquo;Rived in the goodly land.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
