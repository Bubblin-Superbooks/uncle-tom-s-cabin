I expect you to be good, and willing to learn; and I trust in God that I shall be faithful, and willing to teach. And now, my friends, look up, and thank God for the blessing of freedom.&rdquo;</p><p>An aged, partriarchal negro, who had grown gray and blind on the estate, now rose, and, lifting his trembling hand said, &ldquo;Let us give thanks unto the Lord!&rdquo; As all kneeled by one consent, a more touching and hearty Te Deum never ascended to heaven, though borne on the peal of organ, bell and cannon, than came from that honest old heart.</p></div> </div>
