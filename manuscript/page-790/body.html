It will certainly bring down vengeance upon you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My dear cousin, I didn&rsquo;t do it, and I can&rsquo;t help it; I would, if I could. If low-minded, brutal people will act like themselves, what am I to do? they have absolute control; they are irresponsible despots. There would be no use in interfering; there is no law that amounts to anything practically, for such a case. The best we can do is to shut our eyes and ears, and let it alone. It&rsquo;s the only resource left us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How can you shut your eyes and ears? How can you let such things alone?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
