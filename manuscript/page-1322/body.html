May be it&rsquo;s so. The sisters in the convent used to tell me of a day of judgment, when everything is coming to light;&mdash;won&rsquo;t there be vengeance, then!</p><p>&ldquo;They think it&rsquo;s nothing, what we suffer,&mdash;nothing, what our children suffer! It&rsquo;s all a small matter; yet I&rsquo;ve walked the streets when it seemed as if I had misery enough in my one heart to sink the city. I&rsquo;ve wished the houses would fall on me, or the stones sink under me. Yes! and, in the judgment day, I will stand up before God, a witness against those that have ruined me and my children, body and soul!</p></div> </div>
