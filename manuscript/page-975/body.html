If I stay with you, I&rsquo;d try to be good, and not be cross to Dodo, and so on. I don&rsquo;t mean to treat Dodo ill; but, you know, I&rsquo;ve got such a quick temper. I&rsquo;m not really bad to him, though. I give him a picayune, now and then; and you see he dresses well. I think, on the whole, Dodo &rsquo;s pretty well off.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
