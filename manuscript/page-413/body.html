<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;A true fellow, who went to Canada more than a year ago. He heard, after he got there, that his master was so angry at him for going off that he had whipped his poor old mother; and he has come all the way back to comfort her, and get a chance to get her away.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Has he got her?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not yet; he has been hanging about the place, and found no chance yet. Meanwhile, he is going with me as far as Ohio, to put me among friends that helped him, and then he will come back after her.</p><p>&ldquo;Dangerous, very dangerous!&rdquo; said the old man.</p></div> </div>
