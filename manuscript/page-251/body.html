Don&rsquo;t you think to come it over me! Suppose Marks and I have taken up the catchin&rsquo; trade, jest to &rsquo;commodate gentlemen like you, and get nothin&rsquo; for ourselves?&mdash;Not by a long chalk! we&rsquo;ll have the gal out and out, and you keep quiet, or, ye see, we&rsquo;ll have both,&mdash;what&rsquo;s to hinder? Han&rsquo;t you show&rsquo;d us the game? It&rsquo;s as free to us as you, I hope. If you or Shelby wants to chase us, look where the partridges was last year; if you find them or us, you&rsquo;re quite welcome.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
