I don&rsquo;t know why I haven&rsquo;t stopped long ago. I&rsquo;ve always despised it, and myself for it,&mdash;so now, Tom, wipe up your eyes, and go about your errands. Come, come,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;no blessings. I&rsquo;m not so wonderfully good, now,&rdquo; he said, as he gently pushed Tom to the door. &ldquo;There, I&rsquo;ll pledge my honor to you, Tom, you don&rsquo;t see me so again,&rdquo; he said; and Tom went off, wiping his eyes, with great satisfaction.</p></div> </div>
