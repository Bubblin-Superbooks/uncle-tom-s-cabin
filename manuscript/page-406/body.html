<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Sir, I have stood at the door and heard her whipped, when it seemed as if every blow cut into my naked heart, and I couldn&rsquo;t do anything to help her; and she was whipped, sir, for wanting to live a decent Christian life, such as your laws give no slave girl a right to live; and at last I saw her chained with a trader&rsquo;s gang, to be sent to market in Orleans,&mdash;sent there for nothing else but that,&mdash;and that&rsquo;s the last I know of her. Well, I grew up,&mdash;long years and years,&mdash;no father, no mother, no sister, not a living soul that cared for me more than a dog; nothing but whipping, scolding, starving. Why, sir, I&rsquo;ve been so hungry that I have been glad to take the bones they threw to their dogs; and yet, when I was a little fellow, and laid awake whole nights and cried, it wasn&rsquo;t the hunger, it wasn&rsquo;t the whipping, I cried for.</p></div> </div>
