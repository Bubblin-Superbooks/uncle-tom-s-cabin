She raised them up, looked earnestly at them, twined them around her thin fingers, and looked from time to time, anxiously at her father.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just what I&rsquo;ve been foreboding!&rdquo; said Marie; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just what has been preying on my health, from day to day, bringing me downward to the grave, though nobody regards it. I have seen this, long. St. Clare, you will see, after a while, that I was right.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Which will afford you great consolation, no doubt!&rdquo; said St. Clare, in a dry, bitter tone.</p></div> </div>
