<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;What can be coming now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, lately Mas&rsquo;r has been saying that he was a fool to let me marry off the place; that he hates Mr. Shelby and all his tribe, because they are proud, and hold their heads up above him, and that I&rsquo;ve got proud notions from you; and he says he won&rsquo;t let me come here any more, and that I shall take a wife and settle down on his place. At first he only scolded and grumbled these things; but yesterday he told me that I should take Mina for a wife, and settle down in a cabin with her, or he would sell me down river.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
