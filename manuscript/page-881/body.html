But a child&rsquo;s thoughts are rather dim, undefined instincts; and in Eva&rsquo;s noble nature many such were yearning and working, for which she had no power of utterance. When Miss Ophelia expatiated on Topsy&rsquo;s naughty, wicked conduct, the child looked perplexed and sorrowful, but said, sweetly.</p><p>&ldquo;Poor Topsy, why need you steal? You&rsquo;re going to be taken good care of now. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;d rather give you anything of mine, than have you steal it.&rdquo;</p><p>It was the first word of kindness the child had ever heard in her life; and the sweet tone and manner struck strangely on the wild, rude heart, and a sparkle of something like a tear shone in the keen, round, glittering eye; but it was followed by the short laugh and habitual grin.</p></div> </div>
