Besides, what does he want of liberty? He&rsquo;s a great deal better off as he is.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But he does desire it, very earnestly, and his master promised it,&rdquo; said Miss Ophelia.</p><p>&ldquo;I dare say he does want it,&rdquo; said Marie; &ldquo;they all want it, just because they are a discontented set,&mdash;always wanting what they haven&rsquo;t got. Now, I&rsquo;m principled against emancipating, in any case. Keep a negro under the care of a master, and he does well enough, and is respectable; but set them free, and they get lazy, and won&rsquo;t work, and take to drinking, and go all down to be mean, worthless fellows, I&rsquo;ve seen it tried, hundreds of times. It&rsquo;s no favor to set them free.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
