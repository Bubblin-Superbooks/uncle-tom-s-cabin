<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Tom looked up to his master, and answered, &ldquo;Mas&rsquo;r, if you was sick, or in trouble, or dying, and I could save ye, I&rsquo;d give ye my heart&rsquo;s blood; and, if taking every drop of blood in this poor old body would save your precious soul, I&rsquo;d give &rsquo;em freely, as the Lord gave his for me. O, Mas&rsquo;r! don&rsquo;t bring this great sin on your soul! It will hurt you more than &rsquo;t will me! Do the worst you can, my troubles&rsquo;ll be over soon; but, if ye don&rsquo;t repent, yours won&rsquo;t never end!&rdquo;</p><p>Like a strange snatch of heavenly music, heard in the lull of a tempest, this burst of feeling made a moment&rsquo;s blank pause.</p></div> </div>
