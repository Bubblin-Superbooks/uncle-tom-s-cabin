<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;When I came to myself, I was in a nice room,&mdash;but not mine. An old black woman tended me; and a doctor came to see me, and there was a great deal of care taken of me. After a while, I found that he had gone away, and left me at this house to be sold; and that&rsquo;s why they took such pains with me.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to get well, and hoped I shouldn&rsquo;t; but, in spite of me the fever went off and I grew healthy, and finally got up. Then, they made me dress up, every day; and gentlemen used to come in and stand and smoke their cigars, and look at me, and ask questions, and debate my price. I was so gloomy and silent, that none of them wanted me. They threatened to whip me, if I wasn&rsquo;t gayer, and didn&rsquo;t take some pains to make myself agreeable.</p></div> </div>
