<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Legree&rsquo;s brow grew dark, and he broke out, passionately: &ldquo;Yes, I did buy such a fellow,&mdash;and a h&mdash;l of a bargain I had of it, too! The most rebellious, saucy, impudent dog! Set up my niggers to run away; got off two gals, worth eight hundred or a thousand apiece. He owned to that, and, when I bid him tell me where they was, he up and said he knew, but he wouldn&rsquo;t tell; and stood to it, though I gave him the cussedest flogging I ever gave nigger yet. I b&rsquo;lieve he&rsquo;s trying to die; but I don&rsquo;t know as he&rsquo;ll make it out.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
