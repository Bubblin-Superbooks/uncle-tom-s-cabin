<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;My dear child, what do you expect? Here is a whole class,&mdash;debased, uneducated, indolent, provoking,&mdash;put, without any sort of terms or conditions, entirely into the hands of such people as the majority in our world are; people who have neither consideration nor self-control, who haven&rsquo;t even an enlightened regard to their own interest,&mdash;for that&rsquo;s the case with the largest half of mankind. Of course, in a community so organized, what can a man of honorable and humane feelings do, but shut his eyes all he can, and harden his heart? I can&rsquo;t buy every poor wretch I see. I can&rsquo;t turn knight-errant, and undertake to redress every individual case of wrong in such a city as this. The most I can do is to try and keep out of the way of it.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
