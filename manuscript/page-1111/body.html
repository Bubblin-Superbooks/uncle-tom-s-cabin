She was more softened, more gentle; and, though equally assiduous in every duty, it was with a chastened and quiet air, as one who communed with her own heart not in vain. She was more diligent in teaching Topsy,&mdash;taught her mainly from the Bible,&mdash;did not any longer shrink from her touch, or manifest an ill-repressed disgust, because she felt none. She viewed her now through the softened medium that Eva&rsquo;s hand had first held before her eyes, and saw in her only an immortal creature, whom God had sent to be led by her to glory and virtue.</p></div> </div>
