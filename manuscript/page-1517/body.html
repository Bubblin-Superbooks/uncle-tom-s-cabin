<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>For some remarkable reason, ghostly legends were uncommonly rife, about this time, among the servants on Legree&rsquo;s place.</p><p>It was whisperingly asserted that footsteps, in the dead of night, had been heard descending the garret stairs, and patrolling the house. In vain the doors of the upper entry had been locked; the ghost either carried a duplicate key in its pocket, or availed itself of a ghost&rsquo;s immemorial privilege of coming through the keyhole, and promenaded as before, with a freedom that was alarming.</p><p>Authorities were somewhat divided, as to the outward form of the spirit, owing to a custom quite prevalent among negroes,&mdash;and, for aught we know, among whites, too,&mdash;of invariably shutting the eyes, and covering up heads under blankets, petticoats, or whatever else might come in use for a shelter, on these occasions.</p></div> </div>
