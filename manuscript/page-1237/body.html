He laughed to split,&mdash;d&rsquo;ye see the moon, Ho! ho! ho! boys, ho! Ho! yo! hi&mdash;e! oh!&rdquo;</p><p>The singer appeared to make up the song to his own pleasure, generally hitting on rhyme, without much attempt at reason; and the party took up the chorus, at intervals,</p><p>&ldquo;Ho! ho! ho! boys, ho! High&mdash;e&mdash;oh! high&mdash;e&mdash;oh!&rdquo;</p><p>It was sung very boisterouly, and with a forced attempt at merriment; but no wail of despair, no words of impassioned prayer, could have had such a depth of woe in them as the wild notes of the chorus.</p></div> </div>
