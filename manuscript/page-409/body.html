<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I don&rsquo;t want anything of your country, except to be let alone,&mdash;to go peaceably out of it; and when I get to Canada, where the laws will own me and protect me, that shall be my country, and its laws I will obey. But if any man tries to stop me, let him take care, for I am desperate. I&rsquo;ll fight for my liberty to the last breath I breathe. You say your fathers did it; if it was right for them, it is right for me!&rdquo;</p><p>This speech, delivered partly while sitting at the table, and partly walking up and down the room,&mdash;delivered with tears, and flashing eyes, and despairing gestures,&mdash;was altogether too much for the good-natured old body to whom it was addressed, who had pulled out a great yellow silk pocket-handkerchief, and was mopping up his face with great energy.</p></div> </div>
