<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I tell you folks don&rsquo;t run away when they are happy; and when they do run, poor creatures! they suffer enough with cold and hunger and fear, without everybody&rsquo;s turning against them; and, law or no law, I never will, so help me God!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mary! Mary! My dear, let me reason with you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I hate reasoning, John,&mdash;especially reasoning on such subjects. There&rsquo;s a way you political folks have of coming round and round a plain right thing; and you don&rsquo;t believe in it yourselves, when it comes to practice. I know you well enough, John. You don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s right any more than I do; and you wouldn&rsquo;t do it any sooner than I.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
