<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;In Ramah there was a voice heard,&mdash;weeping, and lamentation, and great mourning; Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted.&rdquo; *</p><p>* Jer. 31:15.</p><p>Mr. Haley and Tom jogged onward in their wagon, each, for a time, absorbed in his own reflections. Now, the reflections of two men sitting side by side are a curious thing,&mdash;seated on the same seat, having the same eyes, ears, hands and organs of all sorts, and having pass before their eyes the same objects,&mdash;it is wonderful what a variety we shall find in these same reflections!</p><p>As, for example, Mr. Haley: he thought first of Tom&rsquo;s length, and breadth, and height, and what he would sell for, if he was kept fat and in good case till he got him into market.</p></div> </div>
