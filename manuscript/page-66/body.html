<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;O, George, you didn&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do it? not I!&mdash;but he did. Mas&rsquo;r and Tom pelted the poor drowning creature with stones. Poor thing! he looked at me so mournful, as if he wondered why I didn&rsquo;t save him. I had to take a flogging because I wouldn&rsquo;t do it myself. I don&rsquo;t care. Mas&rsquo;r will find out that I&rsquo;m one that whipping won&rsquo;t tame. My day will come yet, if he don&rsquo;t look out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What are you going to do? O, George, don&rsquo;t do anything wicked; if you only trust in God, and try to do right, he&rsquo;ll deliver you.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
