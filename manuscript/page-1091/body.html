You never saw the Lord.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Felt Him in my soul, Mas&rsquo;r,&mdash;feel Him now! O, Mas&rsquo;r, when I was sold away from my old woman and the children, I was jest a&rsquo;most broke up. I felt as if there warn&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; left; and then the good Lord, he stood by me, and he says, &lsquo;Fear not, Tom;&rsquo; and he brings light and joy in a poor feller&rsquo;s soul,&mdash;makes all peace; and I &rsquo;s so happy, and loves everybody, and feels willin&rsquo; jest to be the Lord&rsquo;s, and have the Lord&rsquo;s will done, and be put jest where the Lord wants to put me.</p></div> </div>
