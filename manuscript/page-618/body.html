<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Again Miss Ophelia sat in blank silence.</p><p>&ldquo;Now, there&rsquo;s no way with servants,&rdquo; said Marie, &ldquo;but to put them down, and keep them down. It was always natural to me, from a child. Eva is enough to spoil a whole house-full. What she will do when she comes to keep house herself, I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know. I hold to being kind to servants&mdash;I always am; but you must make &rsquo;em know their place. Eva never does; there&rsquo;s no getting into the child&rsquo;s head the first beginning of an idea what a servant&rsquo;s place is! You heard her offering to take care of me nights, to let Mammy sleep! That&rsquo;s just a specimen of the way the child would be doing all the time, if she was left to herself.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
