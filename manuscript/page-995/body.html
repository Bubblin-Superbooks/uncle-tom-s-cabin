See here, I&rsquo;ve bought a statuette for you!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, papa,&rdquo; said Eva, putting it gently away, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t deceive yourself!&mdash;I am not any better, I know it perfectly well,&mdash;and I am going, before long. I am not nervous,&mdash;I am not low-spirited. If it were not for you, papa, and my friends, I should be perfectly happy. I want to go,&mdash;I long to go!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
