She wouldn&rsquo;t hear to me, when I telled her I hadn&rsquo;t milk. She said she knowed I could feed it on what other folks eat; and the child kinder pined, and cried, and cried, and cried, day and night, and got all gone to skin and bones, and Missis got sot agin it and she said &rsquo;t wan&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; but crossness. She wished it was dead, she said; and she wouldn&rsquo;t let me have it o&rsquo; nights, cause, she said, it kept me awake, and made me good for nothing. She made me sleep in her room; and I had to put it away off in a little kind o&rsquo; garret, and thar it cried itself to death, one night.</p></div> </div>
