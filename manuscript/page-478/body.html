<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>This speech was addressed to Tom quite confidentially, as if it was something that would be specially interesting to him. Tom made no answer.</p><p>The trader searched the boat from stem to stern, among boxes, bales and barrels, around the machinery, by the chimneys, in vain.</p><p>&ldquo;Now, I say, Tom, be fair about this yer,&rdquo; he said, when, after a fruitless search, he came where Tom was standing. &ldquo;You know something about it, now. Don&rsquo;t tell me,&mdash;I know you do. I saw the gal stretched out here about ten o&rsquo;clock, and ag&rsquo;in at twelve, and ag&rsquo;in between one and two; and then at four she was gone, and you was a sleeping right there all the time. Now, you know something,&mdash;you can&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
