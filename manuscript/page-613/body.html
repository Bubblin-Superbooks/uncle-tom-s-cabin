<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;O, nonsense, child&mdash;nonsense!&rdquo; said Marie; &ldquo;you are such a strange child!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But may I, mamma? I think,&rdquo; she said, timidly, &ldquo;that Mammy isn&rsquo;t well. She told me her head ached all the time, lately.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;O, that&rsquo;s just one of Mammy&rsquo;s fidgets! Mammy is just like all the rest of them&mdash;makes such a fuss about every little headache or finger-ache; it&rsquo;ll never do to encourage it&mdash;never! I&rsquo;m principled about this matter,&rdquo; said she, turning to Miss Ophelia; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll find the necessity of it. If you encourage servants in giving way to every little disagreeable feeling, and complaining of every little ailment, you&rsquo;ll have your hands full. I never complain myself&mdash;nobody knows what I endure. I feel it a duty to bear it quietly, and I do.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
