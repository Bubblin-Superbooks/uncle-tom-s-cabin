She did it with a look of hesitation and bashfulness, quite unlike the eldrich boldness and brightness which was usual with her.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a beautiful bouquet!&rdquo; said Eva, looking at it.</p><p>It was rather a singular one,&mdash;a brilliant scarlet geranium, and one single white japonica, with its glossy leaves. It was tied up with an evident eye to the contrast of color, and the arrangement of every leaf had carefully been studied.</p><p>Topsy looked pleased, as Eva said,&mdash;&ldquo;Topsy, you arrange flowers very prettily. Here,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is this vase I haven&rsquo;t any flowers for. I wish you&rsquo;d arrange something every day for it.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
