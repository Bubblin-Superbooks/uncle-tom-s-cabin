<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Whoever visits some estates there, and witnesses the good-humored indulgence of some masters and mistresses, and the affectionate loyalty of some slaves, might be tempted to dream the oft-fabled poetic legend of a patriarchal institution, and all that; but over and above the scene there broods a portentous shadow&mdash;the shadow of law. So long as the law considers all these human beings, with beating hearts and living affections, only as so many things belonging to a master,&mdash;so long as the failure, or misfortune, or imprudence, or death of the kindest owner, may cause them any day to exchange a life of kind protection and indulgence for one of hopeless misery and toil,&mdash;so long it is impossible to make anything beautiful or desirable in the best regulated administration of slavery.</p></div> </div>
