They are so bad they ought not to live. I don&rsquo;t feel a particle of sympathy for such cases. If they&rsquo;d only behave themselves, it would not happen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But, mamma,&rdquo; said Eva, &ldquo;the poor creature was unhappy; that&rsquo;s what made her drink.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;O, fiddlestick! as if that were any excuse! I&rsquo;m unhappy, very often. I presume,&rdquo; she said, pensively, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;ve had greater trials than ever she had. It&rsquo;s just because they are so bad.
