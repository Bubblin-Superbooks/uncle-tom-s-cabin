Every one of these bills is stolen,&mdash;stolen from poor, starving, sweating creatures, who must go to the devil at last, for his profit. Let him talk about stealing! But come, we may as well go up garret; I&rsquo;ve got a stock of candles there, and some books to pass away the time. You may be pretty sure they won&rsquo;t come there to inquire after us. If they do, I&rsquo;ll play ghost for them.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
