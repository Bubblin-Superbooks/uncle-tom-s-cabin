He looked wistfully on the velvet carpets, and the before unimagined splendors of mirrors, pictures, statues, and curtains, and, like the Queen of Sheba before Solomon, there was no more spirit in him. He looked afraid even to set his feet down.</p><p>&ldquo;See here, Marie,&rdquo; said St. Clare to his wife, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve bought you a coachman, at last, to order. I tell you, he&rsquo;s a regular hearse for blackness and sobriety, and will drive you like a funeral, if you want. Open your eyes, now, and look at him. Now, don&rsquo;t say I never think about you when I&rsquo;m gone.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
