<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; was the murmured response from the lips of Tom and Mammy, and some of the elder ones, who belonged to the Methodist church. The younger and more thoughtless ones, for the time completely overcome, were sobbing, with their heads bowed upon their knees.</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Eva, &ldquo;you all love me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes; oh, yes! indeed we do! Lord bless her!&rdquo; was the involuntary answer of all.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I know you do! There isn&rsquo;t one of you that hasn&rsquo;t always been very kind to me; and I want to give you something that, when you look at, you shall always remember me, I&rsquo;m going to give all of you a curl of my hair; and, when you look at it, think that I loved you and am gone to heaven, and that I want to see you all there.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
