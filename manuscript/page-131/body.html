Haley wants to drive matters, and take possession tomorrow. I&rsquo;m going to get out my horse bright and early, and be off. I can&rsquo;t see Tom, that&rsquo;s a fact; and you had better arrange a drive somewhere, and carry Eliza off. Let the thing be done when she is out of sight.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
