<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>But, how in the world can Miss Ophelia get along with Augustine St. Clare,&mdash;gay, easy, unpunctual, unpractical, sceptical,&mdash;in short,&mdash;walking with impudent and nonchalant freedom over every one of her most cherished habits and opinions?</p><p>To tell the truth, then, Miss Ophelia loved him. When a boy, it had been hers to teach him his catechism, mend his clothes, comb his hair, and bring him up generally in the way he should go; and her heart having a warm side to it, Augustine had, as he usually did with most people, monopolized a large share of it for himself, and therefore it was that he succeeded very easily in persuading her that the &ldquo;path of duty&rdquo; lay in the direction of New Orleans, and that she must go with him to take care of Eva, and keep everything from going to wreck and ruin during the frequent illnesses of his wife.</p></div> </div>
