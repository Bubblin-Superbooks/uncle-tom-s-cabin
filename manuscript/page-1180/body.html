<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Tom had with him quite a sizable trunk full of clothing, as had most others of them. They were ushered, for the night, into a long room, where many other men, of all ages, sizes, and shades of complexion, were assembled, and from which roars of laughter and unthinking merriment were proceeding.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, ha! that&rsquo;s right. Go it, boys,&mdash;go it!&rdquo; said Mr. Skeggs, the keeper. &ldquo;My people are always so merry! Sambo, I see!&rdquo; he said, speaking approvingly to a burly negro who was performing tricks of low buffoonery, which occasioned the shouts which Tom had heard.</p><p>As might be imagined, Tom was in no humor to join these proceedings; and, therefore, setting his trunk as far as possible from the noisy group, he sat down on it, and leaned his face against the wall.</p></div> </div>
