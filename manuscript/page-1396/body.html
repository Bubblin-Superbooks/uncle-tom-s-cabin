<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Who can speak the blessedness of that first day of freedom? Is not the sense of liberty a higher and a finer one than any of the five? To move, speak and breathe,&mdash;go out and come in unwatched, and free from danger! Who can speak the blessings of that rest which comes down on the free man&rsquo;s pillow, under laws which insure to him the rights that God has given to man? How fair and precious to that mother was that sleeping child&rsquo;s face, endeared by the memory of a thousand dangers! How impossible was it to sleep, in the exuberant possession of such blessedness! And yet, these two had not one acre of ground,&mdash;not a roof that they could call their own,&mdash;they had spent their all, to the last dollar. They had nothing more than the birds of the air, or the flowers of the field,&mdash;yet they could not sleep for joy. &ldquo;O, ye who take freedom from man, with what words shall ye answer it to God?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
