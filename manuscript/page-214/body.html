He therefore rode along with an air of dutiful submission, only groaning and vociferating occasionally that &rsquo;t was &ldquo;desp&rsquo;t rough, and bad for Jerry&rsquo;s foot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now, I jest give yer warning,&rdquo; said Haley, &ldquo;I know yer; yer won&rsquo;t get me to turn off this road, with all yer fussin&rsquo;&mdash;so you shet up!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
