It&rsquo;ll kill me!&mdash;it&rsquo;ll break my heart to think what you&rsquo;ve suffered,&mdash;and lying in this old shed, here! Poor, poor fellow!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me poor fellow!&rdquo; said Tom, solemnly, &ldquo;I have been poor fellow; but that&rsquo;s all past and gone, now. I&rsquo;m right in the door, going into glory! O, Mas&rsquo;r George! Heaven has come! I&rsquo;ve got the victory!&mdash;the Lord Jesus has given it to me! Glory be to His name!&rdquo;</p><p>George was awe-struck at the force, the vehemence, the power, with which these broken sentences were uttered. He sat gazing in silence.</p></div> </div>
