<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>t somebody wake up to the beauty of old women? If any want to get up an inspiration under this head, we refer them to our good friend Rachel Halliday, just as she sits there in her little rocking-chair. It had a turn for quacking and squeaking,&mdash;that chair had,&mdash;either from having taken cold in early life, or from some asthmatic affection, or perhaps from nervous derangement; but, as she gently swung backward and forward, the chair kept up a kind of subdued &ldquo;creechy crawchy,&rdquo; that would have been intolerable in any other chair. But old Simeon Halliday often declared it was as good as any music to him, and the children all avowed that they wouldn&rsquo;t miss of hearing mother&rsquo;s chair for anything in the world.</p></div> </div>
