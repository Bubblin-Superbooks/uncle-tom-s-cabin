<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid mine are not properly brought up, then,&rdquo; said Mr. Shelby.</p><p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;pose not; you Kentucky folks spile your niggers. You mean well by &rsquo;em, but &rsquo;tan&rsquo;t no real kindness, arter all. Now, a nigger, you see, what&rsquo;s got to be hacked and tumbled round the world, and sold to Tom, and Dick, and the Lord knows who, &rsquo;tan&rsquo;t no kindness to be givin&rsquo; on him notions and expectations, and bringin&rsquo; on him up too well, for the rough and tumble comes all the harder on him arter. Now, I venture to say, your niggers would be quite chop-fallen in a place where some of your plantation niggers would be singing and whooping like all possessed. Every man, you know, Mr. Shelby, naturally thinks well of his own ways; and I think I treat niggers just about as well as it&rsquo;s ever worth while to treat &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
