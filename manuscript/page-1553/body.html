<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The race that formed the character of the Haytiens was a worn-out, effeminate one; and, of course, the subject race will be centuries in rising to anything.</p><p>&ldquo;Where, then, shall I look? On the shores of Africa I see a republic,&mdash;a republic formed of picked men, who, by energy and self-educating force, have, in many cases, individually, raised themselves above a condition of slavery. Having gone through a preparatory stage of feebleness, this republic has, at last, become an acknowledged nation on the face of the earth,&mdash;acknowledged by both France and England. There it is my wish to go, and find myself a people.</p><p>&ldquo;I am aware, now, that I shall have you all against me; but, before you strike, hear me. During my stay in France, I have followed up, with intense interest, the history of my people in America.</p></div> </div>
