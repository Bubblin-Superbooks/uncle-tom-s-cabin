<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I was lonesome and full of sorrow, and he was so kind and gentle to me; and he told me that he had seen me before I went to the convent, and that he had loved me a great while, and that he would be my friend and protector;&mdash;in short, though he didn&rsquo;t tell me, he had paid two thousand dollars for me, and I was his property,&mdash;I became his willingly, for I loved him. Loved!&rdquo; said the woman, stopping. &ldquo;O, how I did love that man! How I love him now,&mdash;and always shall, while I breathe! He was so beautiful, so high, so noble! He put me into a beautiful house, with servants, horses, and carriages, and furniture, and dresses. Everything that money could buy, he gave me; but I didn&rsquo;t set any value on all that,&mdash;I only cared for him. I loved him better than my God and my own soul, and, if I tried, I couldn&rsquo;t do any other way from what he wanted me to.</p></div> </div>
