<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Weep not for those whom the veil of the tomb, In life&rsquo;s early morning, hath hid from our eyes.*</p><p>* &ldquo;Weep Not for Those,&rdquo; a poem by Thomas Moore (1779-1852).</p><p>Eva&rsquo;s bed-room was a spacious apartment, which, like all the other rooms in the house, opened on to the broad verandah. The room communicated, on one side, with her father and mother&rsquo;s apartment; on the other, with that appropriated to Miss Ophelia. St. Clare had gratified his own eye and taste, in furnishing this room in a style that had a peculiar keeping with the character of her for whom it was intended. The windows were hung with curtains of rose-colored and white muslin, the floor was spread with a matting which had been ordered in Paris, to a pattern of his own device, having round it a border of rose-buds and leaves, and a centre-piece with full-flown roses.</p></div> </div>
