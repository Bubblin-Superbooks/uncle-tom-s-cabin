You are the finest woman in Kentucky; but still you haven&rsquo;t sense to know that you don&rsquo;t understand business;&mdash;women never do, and never can.</p><p>&ldquo;But, at least,&rdquo; said Mrs. Shelby, &ldquo;could not you give me some little insight into yours; a list of all your debts, at least, and of all that is owed to you, and let me try and see if I can&rsquo;t help you to economize.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;O, bother! don&rsquo;t plague me, Emily!&mdash;I can&rsquo;t tell exactly. I know somewhere about what things are likely to be; but there&rsquo;s no trimming and squaring my affairs, as Chloe trims crust off her pies. You don&rsquo;t know anything about business, I tell you.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
