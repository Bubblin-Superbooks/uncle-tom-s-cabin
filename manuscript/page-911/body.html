Poor Aunt Chloe! her heart is so set on it!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, if it is. I think I was premature in promising. I&rsquo;m not sure, now, but it&rsquo;s the best way to tell Chloe, and let her make up her mind to it. Tom&rsquo;ll have another wife, in a year or two; and she had better take up with somebody else.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Shelby, I have taught my people that their marriages are as sacred as ours. I never could think of giving Chloe such advice.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
