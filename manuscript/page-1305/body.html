I&rsquo;m clar, I&rsquo;m set! I know the Lord&rsquo;ll help me, and bring me through.&rdquo;</p><p>The woman did not answer; she sat with her black eyes intently fixed on the floor.</p><p>&ldquo;May be it&rsquo;s the way,&rdquo; she murmured to herself; &ldquo;but those that have given up, there&rsquo;s no hope for them!&mdash;none! We live in filth, and grow loathsome, till we loathe ourselves! And we long to die, and we don&rsquo;t dare to kill ourselves!&mdash;No hope! no hope! no hope?&mdash;this girl now,&mdash;just as old as I was!</p></div> </div>
