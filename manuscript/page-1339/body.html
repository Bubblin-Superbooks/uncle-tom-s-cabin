He never came home but once, after; and then, his mother, with the yearning of a heart that must love something, and has nothing else to love, clung to him, and sought, with passionate prayers and entreaties, to win him from a life of sin, to his soul&rsquo;s eternal good.</p><p>That was Legree&rsquo;s day of grace; then good angels called him; then he was almost persuaded, and mercy held him by the hand. His heart inly relented,&mdash;there was a conflict,&mdash;but sin got the victory, and he set all the force of his rough nature against the conviction of his conscience. He drank and swore,&mdash;was wilder and more brutal than ever.</p></div> </div>
