<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Well, then, Eliza, hear my plan. Mas&rsquo;r took it into his head to send me right by here, with a note to Mr. Symmes, that lives a mile past. I believe he expected I should come here to tell you what I have. It would please him, if he thought it would aggravate &rsquo;Shelby&rsquo;s folks,&rsquo; as he calls &rsquo;em. I&rsquo;m going home quite resigned, you understand, as if all was over. I&rsquo;ve got some preparations made,&mdash;and there are those that will help me; and, in the course of a week or so, I shall be among the missing, some day. Pray for me, Eliza; perhaps the good Lord will hear you.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
