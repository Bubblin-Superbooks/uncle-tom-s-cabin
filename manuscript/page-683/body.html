<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Michael keeps a horse that can soon get ahead of most other horses; and he could shoot ahead and let us know, if there were any danger. I am going out now to warn Jim and the old woman to be in readiness, and to see about the horse. We have a pretty fair start, and stand a good chance to get to the stand before they can come up with us. So, have good courage, friend George; this isn&rsquo;t the first ugly scrape that I&rsquo;ve been in with thy people,&rdquo; said Phineas, as he closed the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Phineas is pretty shrewd,&rdquo; said Simeon. &ldquo;He will do the best that can be done for thee, George.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
