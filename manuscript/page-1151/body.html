<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>We hear often of the distress of the negro servants, on the loss of a kind master; and with good reason, for no creature on God&rsquo;s earth is left more utterly unprotected and desolate than the slave in these circumstances.</p><p>The child who has lost a father has still the protection of friends, and of the law; he is something, and can do something,&mdash;has acknowledged rights and position; the slave has none. The law regards him, in every respect, as devoid of rights as a bale of merchandise. The only possible acknowledgment of any of the longings and wants of a human and immortal creature, which are given to him, comes to him through the sovereign and irresponsible will of his master; and when that master is stricken down, nothing remains.</p></div> </div>
