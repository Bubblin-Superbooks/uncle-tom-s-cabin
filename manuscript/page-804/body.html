<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> My servants were my father&rsquo;s, and, what is more, my mother&rsquo;s; and now they are mine, they and their increase, which bids fair to be a pretty considerable item. My father, you know, came first from New England; and he was just such another man as your father,&mdash;a regular old Roman,&mdash;upright, energetic, noble-minded, with an iron will. Your father settled down in New England, to rule over rocks and stones, and to force an existence out of Nature; and mine settled in Louisiana, to rule over men and women, and force existence out of them. My mother,&rdquo; said St. Clare, getting up and walking to a picture at the end of the room, and gazing upward with a face fervent with veneration, &ldquo;she was divine! Don&rsquo;t look at me so!&mdash;you know what I mean! She probably was of mortal birth; but, as far as ever I could observe, there was no trace of any human weakness or error about her;</p></div> </div>
