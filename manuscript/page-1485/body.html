There stood by him ONE,&mdash;seen by him alone,&mdash;&ldquo;like unto the Son of God.&rdquo;</p><p>The tempter stood by him, too,&mdash;blinded by furious, despotic will,&mdash;every moment pressing him to shun that agony by the betrayal of the innocent. But the brave, true heart was firm on the Eternal Rock. Like his Master, he knew that, if he saved others, himself he could not save; nor could utmost extremity wring from him words, save of prayers and holy trust.</p></div> </div>
