Hark!&rdquo;</p><p>A wild shriek came pealing down the stairway. It came from the garret. Legree&rsquo;s knees knocked together; his face grew white with fear.</p><p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better get your pistols?&rdquo; said Cassy, with a sneer that froze Legree&rsquo;s blood. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time this thing was looked into, you know.
