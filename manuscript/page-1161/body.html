She&rsquo;ll be sorrier, before I&rsquo;ve done with her! I&rsquo;ve endured that child&rsquo;s impudence long enough; and now I&rsquo;ll bring her down,&mdash;I&rsquo;ll make her lie in the dust!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But could not you punish her some other way,&mdash;some way that would be less shameful?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I mean to shame her; that&rsquo;s just what I want. She has all her life presumed on her delicacy, and her good looks, and her lady-like airs, till she forgets who she is;&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll give her one lesson that will bring her down, I fancy!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
