And in those tears they all shed together, the high and the lowly, melted away all the heart-burnings and anger of the oppressed. O, ye who visit the distressed, do ye know that everything your money can buy, given with a cold, averted face, is not worth one honest tear shed in real sympathy?</p><p>&ldquo;My good fellow,&rdquo; said Mrs. Shelby, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t give you anything to do you any good. If I give you money, it will only be taken from you. But I tell you solemnly, and before God, that I will keep trace of you, and bring you back as soon as I can command the money;&mdash;and, till then, trust in God!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
