And you, mothers of America,&mdash;you who have learned, by the cradles of your own children, to love and feel for all mankind,&mdash;by the sacred love you bear your child; by your joy in his beautiful, spotless infancy; by the motherly pity and tenderness with which you guide his growing years; by the anxieties of his education; by the prayers you breathe for his soul&rsquo;s eternal good;&mdash;</p></div> </div>
