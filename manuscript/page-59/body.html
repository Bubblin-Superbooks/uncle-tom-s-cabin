I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ve been very happy, till lately.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So we have, dear,&rdquo; said George. Then drawing his child on his knee, he gazed intently on his glorious dark eyes, and passed his hands through his long curls.</p><p>&ldquo;Just like you, Eliza; and you are the handsomest woman I ever saw, and the best one I ever wish to see; but, oh, I wish I&rsquo;d never seen you, nor you me!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;O, George, how can you!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Eliza, it&rsquo;s all misery, misery, misery! My life is bitter as wormwood; the very life is burning out of me. I&rsquo;m a poor, miserable, forlorn drudge; I shall only drag you down with me, that&rsquo;s all.</p></div> </div>
