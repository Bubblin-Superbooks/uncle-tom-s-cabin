<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Why, my boys have been to Cincinnati, with five hundred dollars&rsquo; worth of colts, and brought me back the money, all straight, time and agin. It stands to reason they should. Treat &rsquo;em like dogs, and you&rsquo;ll have dogs&rsquo; works and dogs&rsquo; actions. Treat &rsquo;em like men, and you&rsquo;ll have men&rsquo;s works.&rdquo; And the honest drover, in his warmth, endorsed this moral sentiment by firing a perfect feu de joi at the fireplace.</p><p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re altogether right, friend,&rdquo; said Mr. Wilson; &ldquo;and this boy described here is a fine fellow&mdash;no mistake about that. He worked for me some half-dozen years in my bagging factory, and he was my best hand, sir. He is an ingenious fellow, too: he invented a machine for the cleaning of hemp&mdash;a really valuable affair; it&rsquo;s gone into use in several factories. His master holds the patent of it.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
