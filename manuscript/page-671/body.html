Yes, though I&rsquo;ve worked hard every day, till I am twenty-five years old, and have not a cent of money, nor a roof to cover me, nor a spot of land to call my own, yet, if they will only let me alone now, I will be satisfied,&mdash;thankful; I will work, and send back the money for you and my boy. As to my old master, he has been paid five times over for all he ever spent for me. I don&rsquo;t owe him anything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But yet we are not quite out of danger,&rdquo; said Eliza; &ldquo;we are not yet in Canada.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
