<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The night after Tom&rsquo;s body had been carried away, he rode to the next town for a carouse, and had a high one. Got home late and tired; locked his door, took out the key, and went to bed.</p><p>After all, let a man take what pains he may to hush it down, a human soul is an awful ghostly, unquiet possession, for a bad man to have. Who knows the metes and bounds of it? Who knows all its awful perhapses,&mdash;those shudderings and tremblings, which it can no more live down than it can outlive its own eternity! What a fool is he who locks his door to keep out spirits, who has in his own bosom a spirit he dares not meet alone,&mdash;whose voice, smothered far down, and piled over with mountains of earthliness, is yet like the forewarning trumpet of doom!</p></div> </div>
