There are things about her so singular; she isn&rsquo;t like me, now, a particle;&rdquo; and Marie sighed, as if this was a truly melancholy consideration.</p><p>Miss Ophelia in her own heart said, &ldquo;I hope she isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; but had prudence enough to keep it down.</p><p>&ldquo;Eva always was disposed to be with servants; and I think that well enough with some children. Now, I always played with father&rsquo;s little negroes&mdash;it never did me any harm. But Eva somehow always seems to put herself on an equality with every creature that comes near her. It&rsquo;s a strange thing about the child. I never have been able to break her of it. St. Clare, I believe, encourages her in it. The fact is, St. Clare indulges every creature under this roof but his own wife.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
