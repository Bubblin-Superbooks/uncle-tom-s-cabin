<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> No, sir, it was for my mother and my sisters,&mdash;it was because I hadn&rsquo;t a friend to love me on earth. I never knew what peace or comfort was. I never had a kind word spoken to me till I came to work in your factory. Mr. Wilson, you treated me well; you encouraged me to do well, and to learn to read and write, and to try to make something of myself; and God knows how grateful I am for it. Then, sir, I found my wife; you&rsquo;ve seen her,&mdash;you know how beautiful she is. When I found she loved me, when I married her, I scarcely could believe I was alive, I was so happy; and, sir, she is as good as she is beautiful.</p></div> </div>
