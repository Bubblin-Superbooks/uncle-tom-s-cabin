<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A tall, bony colored woman now entered the kitchen, bearing on her head a basket of rusks and hot rolls.</p><p>&ldquo;Ho, Prue! you&rsquo;ve come,&rdquo; said Dinah.</p><p>Prue had a peculiar scowling expression of countenance, and a sullen, grumbling voice. She set down her basket, squatted herself down, and resting her elbows on her knees said,</p><p>&ldquo;O Lord! I wish&rsquo;t I &rsquo;s dead!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you wish you were dead?&rdquo; said Miss Ophelia.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be out o&rsquo; my misery,&rdquo; said the woman, gruffly, without taking her eyes from the floor.</p></div> </div>
