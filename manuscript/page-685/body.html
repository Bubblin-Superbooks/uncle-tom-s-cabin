<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Eliza,&rdquo; said George, &ldquo;people that have friends, and houses, and lands, and money, and all those things can&rsquo;t love as we do, who have nothing but each other. Till I knew you, Eliza, no creature had loved me, but my poor, heart-broken mother and sister. I saw poor Emily that morning the trader carried her off. She came to the corner where I was lying asleep, and said, &rsquo;Poor George, your last friend is going. What will become of you, poor boy?&rsquo; And I got up and threw my arms round her, and cried and sobbed, and she cried too; and those were the last kind words I got for ten long years; and my heart all withered up, and felt as dry as ashes, till I met you. And your loving me,&mdash;why, it was almost like raising one from the dead! I&rsquo;ve been a new man ever since! And now, Eliza, I&rsquo;ll give my last drop of blood, but they shall not take you from me. Whoever gets you must walk over my dead body.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
