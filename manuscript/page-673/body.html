<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Our friend Phineas hath discovered something of importance to the interests of thee and thy party, George,&rdquo; said Simeon; &ldquo;it were well for thee to hear it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That I have,&rdquo; said Phineas, &ldquo;and it shows the use of a man&rsquo;s always sleeping with one ear open, in certain places, as I&rsquo;ve always said. Last night I stopped at a little lone tavern, back on the road. Thee remembers the place, Simeon, where we sold some apples, last year, to that fat woman, with the great ear-rings. Well, I was tired with hard driving; and, after my supper I stretched myself down on a pile of bags in the corner, and pulled a buffalo over me, to wait till my bed was ready; and what does I do, but get fast asleep.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
