You are all I have on earth.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Poor old Prue&rsquo;s child was all that she had,&mdash;and yet she had to hear it crying, and she couldn&rsquo;t help it! Papa, these poor creatures love their children as much as you do me. O! do something for them! There&rsquo;s poor Mammy loves her children; I&rsquo;ve seen her cry when she talked about them. And Tom loves his children; and it&rsquo;s dreadful, papa, that such things are happening, all the time!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There, there, darling,&rdquo; said St. Clare, soothingly; &ldquo;only don&rsquo;t distress yourself, don&rsquo;t talk of dying, and I will do anything you wish.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
