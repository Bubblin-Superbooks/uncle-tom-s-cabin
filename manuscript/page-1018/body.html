<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;O, Topsy, poor child, I love you!&rdquo; said Eva, with a sudden burst of feeling, and laying her little thin, white hand on Topsy&rsquo;s shoulder; &ldquo;I love you, because you haven&rsquo;t had any father, or mother, or friends;&mdash;because you&rsquo;ve been a poor, abused child! I love you, and I want you to be good. I am very unwell, Topsy, and I think I shan&rsquo;t live a great while; and it really grieves me, to have you be so naughty. I wish you would try to be good, for my sake;&mdash;it&rsquo;s only a little while I shall be with you.&rdquo;</p><p>The round, keen eyes of the black child were overcast with tears;&mdash;large, bright drops rolled heavily down, one by one, and fell on the little white hand.</p></div> </div>
