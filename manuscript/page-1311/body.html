<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> He had a cousin come to New Orleans, who was his particular friend,&mdash;he thought all the world of him;&mdash;but, from the first time I saw him, I couldn&rsquo;t tell why, I dreaded him; for I felt sure he was going to bring misery on us. He got Henry to going out with him, and often he would not come home nights till two or three o&rsquo;clock. I did not dare say a word; for Henry was so high spirited, I was afraid to. He got him to the gaming-houses; and he was one of the sort that, when he once got a going there, there was no holding back. And then he introduced him to another lady, and I saw soon that his heart was gone from me.</p></div> </div>
