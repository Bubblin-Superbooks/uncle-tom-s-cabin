After a while, he laid his hand on Tom&rsquo;s, who was kneeling beside him, and said, &ldquo;Tom! poor fellow!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What, Mas&rsquo;r?&rdquo; said Tom, earnestly.</p><p>&ldquo;I am dying!&rdquo; said St. Clare, pressing his hand; &ldquo;pray!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you would like a clergyman&mdash;&rdquo; said the physician.</p><p>St. Clare hastily shook his head, and said again to Tom, more earnestly, &ldquo;Pray!&rdquo;</p><p>And Tom did pray, with all his mind and strength, for the soul that was passing,&mdash;the soul that seemed looking so steadily and mournfully from those large, melancholy blue eyes. It was literally prayer offered with strong crying and tears.</p></div> </div>
