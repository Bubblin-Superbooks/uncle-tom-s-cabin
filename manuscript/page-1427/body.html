A softness gathered over the lurid fires of her eye; she looked down, and Tom could feel the relaxing muscles of her hands, as she said,</p><p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you that evil spirits followed me? O! Father Tom, I can&rsquo;t pray,&mdash;I wish I could. I never have prayed since my children were sold! What you say must be right, I know it must; but when I try to pray, I can only hate and curse. I can&rsquo;t pray!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
