<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>George fired,&mdash;the shot entered his side,&mdash;but, though wounded, he would not retreat, but, with a yell like that of a mad bull, he was leaping right across the chasm into the party.</p><p>&ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; said Phineas, suddenly stepping to the front, and meeting him with a push from his long arms, &ldquo;thee isn&rsquo;t wanted here.&rdquo;</p><p>Down he fell into the chasm, crackling down among trees, bushes, logs, loose stones, till he lay bruised and groaning thirty feet below. The fall might have killed him, had it not been broken and moderated by his clothes catching in the branches of a large tree; but he came down with some force, however,&mdash;more than was at all agreeable or convenient.</p></div> </div>
