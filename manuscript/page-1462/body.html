<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>When Emmeline reached the garret, she found an immense box, in which some heavy pieces of furniture had once been brought, turned on its side, so that the opening faced the wall, or rather the eaves. Cassy lit a small lamp, and creeping round under the eaves, they established themselves in it. It was spread with a couple of small mattresses and some pillows; a box near by was plentifully stored with candles, provisions, and all the clothing necessary to their journey, which Cassy had arranged into bundles of an astonishingly small compass.</p><p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Cassy, as she fixed the lamp into a small hook, which she had driven into the side of the box for that purpose; &ldquo;this is to be our home for the present. How do you like it?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
