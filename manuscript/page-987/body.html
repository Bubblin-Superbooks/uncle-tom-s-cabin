<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Poor Eva heard some of these speeches; and nearly cried her little eyes out, in pity for her mamma, and in sorrow that she should make her so much distress.</p><p>In a week or two, there was a great improvement of symptoms,&mdash;one of those deceitful lulls, by which her inexorable disease so often beguiles the anxious heart, even on the verge of the grave. Eva&rsquo;s step was again in the garden,&mdash;in the balconies; she played and laughed again,&mdash;and her father, in a transport, declared that they should soon have her as hearty as anybody. Miss Ophelia and the physician alone felt no encouragement from this illusive truce. There was one other heart, too, that felt the same certainty, and that was the little heart of Eva.</p></div> </div>
