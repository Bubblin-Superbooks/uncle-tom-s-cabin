<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Legree stood aghast, and looked at Tom; and there was such a silence, that the tick of the old clock could be heard, measuring, with silent touch, the last moments of mercy and probation to that hardened heart.</p><p>It was but a moment. There was one hesitating pause,&mdash;one irresolute, relenting thrill,&mdash;and the spirit of evil came back, with seven-fold vehemence; and Legree, foaming with rage, smote his victim to the ground.</p><p>Scenes of blood and cruelty are shocking to our ear and heart. What man has nerve to do, man has not nerve to hear. What brother-man and brother-Christian must suffer, cannot be told us, even in our secret chamber, it so harrows the soul! And yet, oh my country! these things are done under the shadow of thy laws! O, Christ! thy church sees them, almost in silence!</p></div> </div>
