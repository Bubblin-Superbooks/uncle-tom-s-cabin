<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>There was a gentle bustle at the Quaker house, as the afternoon drew to a close. Rachel Halliday moved quietly to and fro, collecting from her household stores such needments as could be arranged in the smallest compass, for the wanderers who were to go forth that night. The afternoon shadows stretched eastward, and the round red sun stood thoughtfully on the horizon, and his beams shone yellow and calm into the little bed-room where George and his wife were sitting. He was sitting with his child on his knee, and his wife&rsquo;s hand in his. Both looked thoughtful and serious and traces of tears were on their cheeks.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Eliza,&rdquo; said George, &ldquo;I know all you say is true. You are a good child,&mdash;a great deal better than I am; and I will try to do as you say. I&rsquo;ll try to act worthy of a free man. I&rsquo;ll try to feel like a Christian.</p></div> </div>
