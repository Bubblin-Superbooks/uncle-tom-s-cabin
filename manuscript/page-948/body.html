Wouldn&rsquo;t you teach them to play on the piano, and paint on velvet?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d teach them to read their own Bible, and write their own letters, and read letters that are written to them,&rdquo; said Eva, steadily. &ldquo;I know, mamma, it does come very hard on them that they can&rsquo;t do these things.
