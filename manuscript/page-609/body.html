<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I wish, now, I&rsquo;d insisted on it, and married Mammy to somebody else; but I was foolish and indulgent, and didn&rsquo;t want to insist. I told Mammy, at the time, that she mustn&rsquo;t ever expect to see him more than once or twice in her life again, for the air of father&rsquo;s place doesn&rsquo;t agree with my health, and I can&rsquo;t go there; and I advised her to take up with somebody else; but no&mdash;she wouldn&rsquo;t. Mammy has a kind of obstinacy about her, in spots, that everybody don&rsquo;t see as I do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Has she children?&rdquo; said Miss Ophelia.</p></div> </div>
