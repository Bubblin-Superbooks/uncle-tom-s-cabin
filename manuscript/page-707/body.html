We don&rsquo;t own your laws; we don&rsquo;t own your country; we stand here as free, under God&rsquo;s sky, as you are; and, by the great God that made us, we&rsquo;ll fight for our liberty till we die.&rdquo;</p><p>George stood out in fair sight, on the top of the rock, as he made his declaration of independence; the glow of dawn gave a flush to his swarthy cheek, and bitter indignation and despair gave fire to his dark eye; and, as if appealing from man to the justice of God, he raised his hand to heaven as he spoke.</p></div> </div>
