In a few days we shall be sent off to auction, Tom.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The Lord&rsquo;s will be done!&rdquo; said Tom, folding his arms and sighing heavily.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never get another such a master,&rdquo; said Adolph, apprehensively; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;d rather be sold than take my chance under Missis.&rdquo;</p><p>Tom turned away; his heart was full. The hope of liberty, the thought of distant wife and children, rose up before his patient soul, as to the mariner shipwrecked almost in port rises the vision of the church-spire and loving roofs of his native village, seen over the top of some black wave only for one last farewell.</p></div> </div>
