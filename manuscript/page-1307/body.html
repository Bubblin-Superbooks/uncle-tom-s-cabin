<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> My mother was a slave woman, and my father had always meant to set me free; but he had not done it, and so I was set down in the list. I&rsquo;d always known who I was, but never thought much about it. Nobody ever expects that a strong, healthy man is going to die. My father was a well man only four hours before he died;&mdash;it was one of the first cholera cases in New Orleans. The day after the funeral, my father&rsquo;s wife took her children, and went up to her father&rsquo;s plantation. I thought they treated me strangely, but didn&rsquo;t know. There was a young lawyer who they left to settle the business; and he came every day, and was about the house, and spoke very politely to me. He brought with him, one day, a young man, whom I thought the handsomest I had ever seen. I shall never forget that evening. I walked with him in the garden.</p></div> </div>
