It needs not to be told;&mdash;every day is telling it,&mdash;telling it, too, in the ear of One who is not deaf, though he be long silent.</p><p>The young man who had spoken for the cause of humanity and God before stood with folded arms, looking on this scene. He turned, and Haley was standing at his side. &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; he said, speaking with thick utterance, &ldquo;how can you, how dare you, carry on a trade like this? Look at those poor creatures! Here I am, rejoicing in my heart that I am going home to my wife and child; and the same bell which is a signal to carry me onward towards them will part this poor man and his wife forever. Depend upon it, God will bring you into judgment for this.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
