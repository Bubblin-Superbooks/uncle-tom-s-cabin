<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Professor Stowe says, &ldquo;With all these, except G&mdash;&mdash;, I have been, for some years, personally acquainted, and make my statements from my own knowledge.&rdquo;</p><p>The writer well remembers an aged colored woman, who was employed as a washerwoman in her father&rsquo;s family. The daughter of this woman married a slave. She was a remarkably active and capable young woman, and, by her industry and thrift, and the most persevering self-denial, raised nine hundred dollars for her husband&rsquo;s freedom, which she paid, as she raised it, into the hands of his master. She yet wanted a hundred dollars of the price, when he died. She never recovered any of the money.</p></div> </div>
