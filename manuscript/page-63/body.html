I asked him to stop, as pleasant as I could,&mdash;he just kept right on. I begged him again, and then he turned on me, and began striking me. I held his hand, and then he screamed and kicked and ran to his father, and told him that I was fighting him. He came in a rage, and said he&rsquo;d teach me who was my master; and he tied me to a tree, and cut switches for young master, and told him that he might whip me till he was tired;&mdash;and he did do it! If I don&rsquo;t make him remember it, some time!&rdquo; and the brow of the young man grew dark, and his eyes burned with an expression that made his young wife tremble. &ldquo;Who made this man my master? That&rsquo;s what I want to know!&rdquo; he said.</p></div> </div>
