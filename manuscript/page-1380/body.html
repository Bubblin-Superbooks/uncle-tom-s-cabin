Her description&rsquo;s out in Sandusky.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We will attend to that matter,&rdquo; said Dorcas, with characteristic composure.</p><p>As we at this place take leave of Tom Loker, we may as well say, that, having lain three weeks at the Quaker dwelling, sick with a rheumatic fever, which set in, in company with his other afflictions, Tom arose from his bed a somewhat sadder and wiser man; and, in place of slave-catching, betook himself to life in one of the new settlements, where his talents developed themselves more happily in trapping bears, wolves, and other inhabitants of the forest, in which he made himself quite a name in the land. Tom always spoke reverently of the Quakers.</p></div> </div>
