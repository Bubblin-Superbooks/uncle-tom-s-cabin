The auctioneer sees his advantage, and expatiates volubly in mingled French and English, and bids rise in rapid succession.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do anything in reason,&rdquo; said the benevolent-looking gentleman, pressing in and joining with the bids. In a few moments they have run beyond his purse. He is silent; the auctioneer grows warmer; but bids gradually drop off. It lies now between an aristocratic old citizen and our bullet-headed acquaintance.</p></div> </div>
