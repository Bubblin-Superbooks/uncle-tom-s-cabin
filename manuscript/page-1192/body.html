With a deadly sickness at her heart, she remembered how he had looked at Emmeline&rsquo;s hands, and lifted up her curly hair, and pronounced her a first-rate article. Susan had been trained as a Christian, brought up in the daily reading of the Bible, and had the same horror of her child&rsquo;s being sold to a life of shame that any other Christian mother might have; but she had no hope,&mdash;no protection.</p><p>&ldquo;Mother, I think we might do first rate, if you could get a place as cook, and I as chambermaid or seamstress, in some family. I dare say we shall. Let&rsquo;s both look as bright and lively as we can, and tell all we can do, and perhaps we shall,&rdquo; said Emmeline.</p></div> </div>
