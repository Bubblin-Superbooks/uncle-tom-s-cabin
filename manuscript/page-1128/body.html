After tea, he and Marie and Miss Ophelia took possession of the parlor almost in silence.</p><p>Marie disposed herself on a lounge, under a silken mosquito curtain, and was soon sound asleep. Miss Ophelia silently busied herself with her knitting. St. Clare sat down to the piano, and began playing a soft and melancholy movement with the &AElig;olian accompaniment. He seemed in a deep reverie, and to be soliloquizing to himself by music. After a little, he opened one of the drawers, took out an old music-book whose leaves were yellow with age, and began turning it over.</p><p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said to Miss Ophelia, &ldquo;this was one of my mother&rsquo;s books,&mdash;and here is her handwriting,&mdash;come and look at it. She copied and arranged this from Mozart&rsquo;s Requiem.&rdquo; Miss Ophelia came accordingly.</p></div> </div>
