It ran as follows:</p><p>&ldquo;When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all his holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: and before him shall be gathered all nations; and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats.&rdquo; St. Clare read on in an animated voice, till he came to the last of the verses.</p></div> </div>
