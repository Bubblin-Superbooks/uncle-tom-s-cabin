Mas&rsquo;r gen&rsquo;ly hired him out. They took me off so quick, I didn&rsquo;t even have time to see him; and I&rsquo;s got four children. O, dear me!&rdquo; said the woman, covering her face with her hands.</p><p>It is a natural impulse, in every one, when they hear a tale of distress, to think of something to say by way of consolation.
