<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Why, dear child, what has made your poor little heart so sad? You have had everything, to make you happy, that could be given you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I had rather be in heaven; though, only for my friends&rsquo; sake, I would be willing to live. There are a great many things here that make me sad, that seem dreadful to me; I had rather be there; but I don&rsquo;t want to leave you,&mdash;it almost breaks my heart!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What makes you sad, and seems dreadful, Eva?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;O, things that are done, and done all the time. I feel sad for our poor people; they love me dearly, and they are all good and kind to me. I wish, papa, they were all free.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
