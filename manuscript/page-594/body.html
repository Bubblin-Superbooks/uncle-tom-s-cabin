Seems to me, Dolph,&rdquo; he added, laying his finger on the elegant figured satin vest that Adolph was sporting, &ldquo;seems to me that&rsquo;s my vest.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;O! Master, this vest all stained with wine; of course, a gentleman in Master&rsquo;s standing never wears a vest like this. I understood I was to take it. It does for a poor nigger-fellow, like me.&rdquo;</p><p>And Adolph tossed his head, and passed his fingers through his scented hair, with a grace.</p><p>&ldquo;So, that&rsquo;s it, is it?&rdquo; said St. Clare, carelessly. &ldquo;Well, here, I&rsquo;m going to show this Tom to his mistress, and then you take him to the kitchen; and mind you don&rsquo;t put on any of your airs to him. He&rsquo;s worth two such puppies as you.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
