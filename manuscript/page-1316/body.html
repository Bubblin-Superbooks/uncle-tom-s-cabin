<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> One day, I was out walking, and passed by the calaboose; I saw a crowd about the gate, and heard a child&rsquo;s voice,&mdash;and suddenly my Henry broke away from two or three men who were holding him, and ran, screaming, and caught my dress. They came up to him, swearing dreadfully; and one man, whose face I shall never forget, told him that he wouldn&rsquo;t get away so; that he was going with him into the calaboose, and he&rsquo;d get a lesson there he&rsquo;d never forget. I tried to beg and plead,&mdash;they only laughed; the poor boy screamed and looked into my face, and held on to me, until, in tearing him off, they tore the skirt of my dress half away; and they carried him in, screaming &rsquo;Mother! mother! mother!&rsquo; There was one man stood there seemed to pity me. I offered him all the money I had, if he&rsquo;d only interfere.</p></div> </div>
