Emmeline did not faint, and succeeded in plunging, with Cassy, into a part of the labyrinth of swamp, so deep and dark that it was perfectly hopeless for Legree to think of following them, without assistance.</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, chuckling brutally; &ldquo;at any rate, they&rsquo;ve got themselves into a trap now&mdash;the baggage! They&rsquo;re safe enough. They shall sweat for it!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hulloa, there! Sambo! Quimbo!
