<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I an&rsquo;t a Christian like you, Eliza; my heart&rsquo;s full of bitterness; I can&rsquo;t trust in God. Why does he let things be so?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;O, George, we must have faith. Mistress says that when all things go wrong to us, we must believe that God is doing the very best.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy to say for people that are sitting on their sofas and riding in their carriages; but let &rsquo;em be where I am, I guess it would come some harder. I wish I could be good; but my heart burns, and can&rsquo;t be reconciled, anyhow. You couldn&rsquo;t in my place,&mdash;you can&rsquo;t now, if I tell you all I&rsquo;ve got to say. You don&rsquo;t know the whole yet.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
