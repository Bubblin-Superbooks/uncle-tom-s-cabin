<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The incident of the mother&rsquo;s crossing the Ohio river on the ice is a well-known fact. The story of &ldquo;old Prue,&rdquo; in the second volume, was an incident that fell under the personal observation of a brother of the writer, then collecting-clerk to a large mercantile house, in New Orleans. From the same source was derived the character of the planter Legree. Of him her brother thus wrote, speaking of visiting his plantation, on a collecting tour; &ldquo;He actually made me feel of his fist, which was like a blacksmith&rsquo;s hammer, or a nodule of iron, telling me that it was &lsquo;calloused with knocking down niggers.&rsquo; When I left the plantation, I drew a long breath, and felt as if I had escaped from an ogre&rsquo;s den.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
