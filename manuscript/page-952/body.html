<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>About this time, St. Clare&rsquo;s brother Alfred, with his eldest son, a boy of twelve, spent a day or two with the family at the lake.</p><p>No sight could be more singular and beautiful than that of these twin brothers. Nature, instead of instituting resemblances between them, had made them opposites on every point; yet a mysterious tie seemed to unite them in a closer friendship than ordinary.</p><p>They used to saunter, arm in arm, up and down the alleys and walks of the garden. Augustine, with his blue eyes and golden hair, his ethereally flexible form and vivacious features; and Alfred, dark-eyed, with haughty Roman profile, firmly-knit limbs, and decided bearing. They were always abusing each other&rsquo;s opinions and practices, and yet never a whit the less absorbed in each other&rsquo;s society; in fact, the very contrariety seemed to unite them, like the attraction between opposite poles of the magnet.</p></div> </div>
