I cursed him before God, and told him I&rsquo;d die sooner than live with him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Just as you please,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;but, if you don&rsquo;t behave reasonably, I&rsquo;ll sell both the children, where you shall never see them again.&rsquo; He told me that he always had meant to have me, from the first time he saw me; and that he had drawn Henry on, and got him in debt, on purpose to make him willing to sell me. That he got him in love with another woman; and that I might know, after all that, that he should not give up for a few airs and tears, and things of that sort.</p></div> </div>
