You Christians don&rsquo;t know how these things look to us. There&rsquo;s a God for you, but is there any for us?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;O, now, don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t, my boy!&rdquo; said the old man, almost sobbing as he spoke; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t feel so! There is&mdash;there is; clouds and darkness are around about him, but righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne. There&rsquo;s a God, George,&mdash;believe it; trust in Him, and I&rsquo;m sure He&rsquo;ll help you. Everything will be set right,&mdash;if not in this life, in another.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
