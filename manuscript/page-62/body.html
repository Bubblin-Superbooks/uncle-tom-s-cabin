<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;O, George! George! you frighten me! Why, I never heard you talk so; I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll do something dreadful. I don&rsquo;t wonder at your feelings, at all; but oh, do be careful&mdash;do, do&mdash;for my sake&mdash;for Harry&rsquo;s!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have been careful, and I have been patient, but it&rsquo;s growing worse and worse; flesh and blood can&rsquo;t bear it any longer;&mdash;every chance he can get to insult and torment me, he takes. I thought I could do my work well, and keep on quiet, and have some time to read and learn out of work hours; but the more he sees I can do, the more he loads on. He says that though I don&rsquo;t say anything, he sees I&rsquo;ve got the devil in me, and he means to bring it out; and one of these days it will come out in a way that he won&rsquo;t like, or I&rsquo;m mistaken!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
