<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I should like to see you doing that, John&mdash;I really should! Turning a woman out of doors in a snowstorm, for instance; or may be you&rsquo;d take her up and put her in jail, wouldn&rsquo;t you? You would make a great hand at that!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, it would be a very painful duty,&rdquo; began Mr. Bird, in a moderate tone.</p><p>&ldquo;Duty, John! don&rsquo;t use that word! You know it isn&rsquo;t a duty&mdash;it can&rsquo;t be a duty! If folks want to keep their slaves from running away, let &rsquo;em treat &rsquo;em well,&mdash;that&rsquo;s my doctrine. If I had slaves (as I hope I never shall have), I&rsquo;d risk their wanting to run away from me, or you either, John.</p></div> </div>
