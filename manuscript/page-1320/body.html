<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> O, that child!&mdash;how I loved it! How just like my poor Henry the little thing looked! But I had made up my mind,&mdash;yes, I had. I would never again let a child live to grow up! I took the little fellow in my arms, when he was two weeks old, and kissed him, and cried over him; and then I gave him laudanum, and held him close to my bosom, while he slept to death. How I mourned and cried over it! and who ever dreamed that it was anything but a mistake, that had made me give it the laudanum? but it&rsquo;s one of the few things that I&rsquo;m glad of, now. I am not sorry, to this day; he, at least, is out of pain.</p></div> </div>
