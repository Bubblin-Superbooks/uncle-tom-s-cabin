<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>There is no monument to mark the last resting-place of our friend. He needs none! His Lord knows where he lies, and will raise him up, immortal, to appear with him when he shall appear in his glory.</p><p>Pity him not! Such a life and death is not for pity! Not in the riches of omnipotence is the chief glory of God; but in self-denying, suffering love! And blessed are the men whom he calls to fellowship with him, bearing their cross after him with patience. Of such it is written, &ldquo;Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
