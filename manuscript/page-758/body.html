<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Now, there&rsquo;s Dinah gets you a capital dinner,&mdash;soup, ragout, roast fowl, dessert, ice-creams and all,&mdash;and she creates it all out of chaos and old night down there, in that kitchen. I think it really sublime, the way she manages. But, Heaven bless us! if we are to go down there, and view all the smoking and squatting about, and hurryscurryation of the preparatory process, we should never eat more! My good cousin, absolve yourself from that! It&rsquo;s more than a Catholic penance, and does no more good. You&rsquo;ll only lose your own temper, and utterly confound Dinah. Let her go her own way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But, Augustine, you don&rsquo;t know how I found things.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
