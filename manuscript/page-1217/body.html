So, what&rsquo;s yer name,&mdash;you belong to the church, eh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Mas&rsquo;r,&rdquo; said Tom, firmly.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll soon have that out of you. I have none o&rsquo; yer bawling, praying, singing niggers on my place; so remember. Now, mind yourself,&rdquo; he said, with a stamp and a fierce glance of his gray eye, directed at Tom, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m your church now!
