<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; said Cassy. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I waited?&mdash;waited till my head is dizzy and my heart sick? What has he made me suffer? What has he made hundreds of poor creatures suffer? Isn&rsquo;t he wringing the life-blood out of you? I&rsquo;m called on; they call me! His time&rsquo;s come, and I&rsquo;ll have his heart&rsquo;s blood!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no, no!&rdquo; said Tom, holding her small hands, which were clenched with spasmodic violence. &ldquo;No, ye poor, lost soul, that ye mustn&rsquo;t do. The dear, blessed Lord never shed no blood but his own, and that he poured out for us when we was enemies. Lord, help us to follow his steps, and love our enemies.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
