I&rsquo;ve worked sometimes whole afternoons, trimming her caps, and getting her ready to go to a party. As to abuse, she don&rsquo;t know what it is. She never was whipped more than once or twice in her whole life. She has her strong coffee or her tea every day, with white sugar in it. It&rsquo;s abominable, to be sure; but St. Clare will have high life below-stairs, and they every one of them live just as they please. The fact is, our servants are over-indulged.</p></div> </div>
