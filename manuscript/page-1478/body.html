Legree had told them, at first, that he had bought him for a general overseer, in his absence; and this had begun an ill will, on their part, which had increased, in their debased and servile natures, as they saw him becoming obnoxious to their master&rsquo;s displeasure. Quimbo, therefore, departed, with a will, to execute his orders.</p><p>Tom heard the message with a forewarning heart; for he knew all the plan of the fugitives&rsquo; escape, and the place of their present concealment;&mdash;he knew the deadly character of the man he had to deal with, and his despotic power. But he felt strong in God to meet death, rather than betray the helpless.</p></div> </div>
